 * A property encapsulates a value which should be user-changeable. A property almost

 * Property. Per PropertyOwner, the <code>identifier</code> needs to be unique and can be
 * used as a URI. This class is an abstract base class and each subclass (most notable
 * TemplateProperty) needs to implement the methods Property::className, Property::get,
 * Property::set, Property::type(), Property::getLuaValue, Property::setLuaValue,
 * Property::getStringValue, Property::setStringValue and Property::typeLua to make full
 * use of the infrastructure.
 * The most common types can be implemented by creating a specialized instantiation of
 * TemplateProperty, which provides default implementations for these methods.
 *
 * The onChange method can be used by the PropertyOwner to listen to changes that happen
 * to the Property. The parameter is a function object that gets called after new value
 * has been set.
 * The metaData allows the developer to specify additional information about the Property
 * which might be used in GUI representations. One example would be a glm::vec4 property,
 * (Vec4Property) that can either represent a 4-dimensional position, a powerscaled
 * coordinate, a light position, or other things, requiring different GUI representations.
