## How to contribute
The easiest way to contribute is through a separate fork of the repository and submitting a pull-request. One of the core developers will judge the pull request and integrate it into the main `master` branch. Preferably, there is an accompanying issue (created by you or not) which is solved by the PR. In this case, feel free to use the phrase "(closes #XXX)" in the text of the pull request, where `XXX` is the number of the issue that you have solved. The PR should be in its own separate branch following the naming `pr/feature`, where `feature` is a short, descripting name of the additional feature or bug contained in the PR.
