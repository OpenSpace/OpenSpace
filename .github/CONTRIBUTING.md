# How to contribute
## Code changes
The easiest way to contribute is through a separate fork of the repository and submitting a Pull Request. One of the core developers will review the pull request and integrate it into the `master` branch. Preferably, for each Pull Request, there is an accompanying issue (created by you or not) which the Pull Request addresses. In this case, feel free to use the phrase "(closes #XXX)" in the text of the Pull Request, where `XXX` is the number of the issue that you have solved. The PR should be in its own separate branch following the naming `pr/feature`, where `feature` is a short, descripting name of the additional feature or bug contained in the PR.

For more information we refer to the [Documentation](https://docs.openspaceproject.com). If there are any questions, feel free to contact us via [email](mailto:support@openspaceproject.com?subject=OpenSpace: Contributing).
