If you find any security issues with OpenSpace of any of its components, please __do not report the issue here on GitHub__. Instead send an email to support@openspaceproject.com, preferrably with the prefix "Vulnerability: " as these are processed immediately. Alternatively, you can also report it @Alex Bock or @Megan Villa on the public Slack for which you can sign up [here](https://join.slack.com/t/openspacesupport/shared_invite/zt-37niq6y9-T0JaCIk4UoFLI4VF5U9Vsw). Please do not report it in the general channel, but as a private message instead.

Thank you!
