 Revised: Mar 27, 2018          Tesla Roadster (spacecraft)             -143205
          (solution #10)
 
 Tesla Roadster (AKA: Starman, 2018-017A)

 NOTE:

  Visibility: 
   20th magnitude until Feb 20, 
   22nd magnitude through mid-April 
   Brighter than 26th magnitude into mid-June

  2018-Mar-01: Radial non-gravitational acceleration A1 estimated from data
               (nominally solar radiation pressure)
  2018-Mar-27: Two reporting sites (J04 & K93) extend data arc one month.
               A1 estimate of s10 is reduced 1.2-sigma compared to s9. 

 LAUNCHED: 
  2018-Feb-06 20:45 UTC by Falcon Heavy (FH-1) from Kennedy Space Center, USA 
  (launchpad 39A)

 BACKGROUND:
  Dummy payload from the first launch of SpaceX Falcon Heavy launch vehicle. 
  Consists of a standard Tesla Roadster automobile and a spacesuit-wearing 
  mannequin nicknamed "Starman". 
 
  Also includes a Hot Wheels toy model Roadster on the car's dash with a 
  mini-Starman inside. A data storage device placed inside the car contains 
  a copy of Isaac Asimov's "Foundation" novels. A plaque on the attachment 
  fitting between the Falcon Heavy upper stage and the Tesla is etched with 
  the names of more than 6,000 SpaceX employees.
 
  After orbiting the Earth for 5 hours, a third burn by the second stage was 
  completed at approximately 02:30 UTC Feb 7, placing the dummy payload in a 
  heliocentric orbit having a perihelion of 0.99 au and aphelion ~1.67 au.

  The object stack consists of a Merlin 1D Vacuum second stage with Extended 
  Nozzle, Payload Attachment Fitting, and Tesla Roadster on mount.

  Roadster mass: ~1250 kg (with batteries), ~800 kg (without ESS/batteries)

 TRAJECTORY:
  This trajectory is based on JPL solution #10, a fit to 364 ground-based 
  optical astrometric measurements spanning 2018 Feb 8.2 to March 19.1

  NOTE: 
  How to obtain optional statistical uncertainty output & generate an SPK file:

  Since this is a spacecraft and not part of the asteroid and comet database 
  which normally holds orbit covariance data, some functions like statistical 
  output and SPK file generation aren't automatically available for this object.

  However, such optional extended output is possible with some extra steps. 

  To propagate statistical uncertainties for this object, the full statistical
  orbit solution (given below) can be manually input back into Horizons as a 
  "user-defined object" using the telnet or e-mail interfaces (not possible
  with the browser interface).
 
  To do this and activate statistical or SPK file output ...

  Using the telnet interface (command-line "telnet ssd.jpl.nasa.gov 6775"),
  enter ";" to drop into user-input mode then cut-and-paste each line shown 
  below, one at a time. The lines of numbers after SRC must be in the order 
  shown.

  For SPK file generation, only the first four lines need be input: the
  EPOCH, orbital element lines starting with "EC" and "OM", and  the
  non-gravitational acceleration model (line starting with "A1").

  SRC lines are needed only for (optional) statistical output and the 
  H & G values only for (optional) visual magnitude output.

    H= 25.289 G= 0.15

  When done, press a blank return to exit input mode. 

  Enter "J" at the prompt to indicate heliocentric J2000 ecliptic data has 
  been supplied. Then at the next prompt, input an arbitrary name 
  (i.e., Roadster).
 
  Horizons will then proceed as usual, but with statistical output and SPK 
  file generation now available as options.

  A basic and identical tracking ephemeris can be produced without doing any 
  of this, but statistical uncertainty quantities requested will be marked
  "n.a.", meaning not available, and SPK generation won't be an option.

  NOTE: long-term predictions
  Over time, trajectory prediction errors could increase more rapidly than 
  the formal statistics indicate due to unmodeled thermal re-radiation or 
  outgassing accelerations that are not currently characterized but may exist.
