  Description = [[
  This visualization shows the Sun's magnetic field using data from the WSA
  (Wang-Sheeley-Arge) simulation model. The field lines trace the Sun's magnetic field.
  Some loop back into the Sun (closed, shown in yellow), while others stream into space
  (open), colored by their position relative to the heliospheric current sheet. On the
  Sun's surface, white and black indicate areas of positive and negative magnetic
  polarity, respectively. Understanding these fields is critical: solar activity like
  Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) can disrupt satellites, power grids, and pose risks to
  astronauts and spacecraft throughout the solar system. All data is fetched live, giving
  you the latest view of our dynamic Sun.
