  Description = [[
    This profile shows the Sun and its magnetic polarities, using data from the WSA
    (Wang-Sheeley-Arge) simulation model version 5.4. The solar coronal portion of WSA is
    comprised of two potential field type models. The inner model is Potential Field
    Source Surface (PFSS) which specifies the coronal field from the inner, photospheric
    boundary at 1 solar radii (Rs) to its outer boundary or source surface at 2.5Rs. The
    outer model is the Schatten Current Sheet (SCS) model. The radial magnetic field
    components of the PFSS magnetic field solution at 2.5Rs are used as the inner boundary
    condition to the SCS model. All data is downloaded dynamically, bringing you the
    latest data from the model. You can find these assets in the Scene menu under
    "Solar System/Heliosphere". Under the "WSA Coronal Model" submenu, you will find extra
    options for the solar field lines and surface features. The four different sets of
    field lines are all following the magnetic fields but traced from different locations.
    They can be colored by their different parameters in the data, for example polarity or
    open or closed field lines. The two elements named "Solar Surface" show the magnetic
    polarities, but have other options in the settings under "Texture Layer Options". The
    same goes for the two named "Velocity at Outer Boundary". However, the two named
    "Magnetic Field at 5Rs" do not have other options. Each asset includes settings for
    appearance. If field lines are looking too bright against a bright background, try
    changing the setting for additive blending. Additionally there is an option to save
    the downloaded data for future use (by default, the data is not cached). Each data
    file remains active until the next one in the sequence becomes available. To see which
    file is currently being used, check the "Texture Source" field for each asset in the
    GUI. In the visualization, the white line shooting out from the Sun, along with the
    white arc, always points in the direction of Earth. The red arc is the Carrington
    prime meridian which is longitude 0 of the Sun, and the green grid shows lines with a
    10-degree separation. You can also toggle a white background from the Actions panel.
    If no data is showing, most likely the selected time is outside of the data range
    (e.g., too far in the future or the past for the dynamic data to be available).
    Alternatively, the files failed to download. For more information on the simulation
    model, see https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/WSA~5.4.
