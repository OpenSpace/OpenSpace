    Description = "This profile shows the sun as it is right now. The visualizations are results from the WSA model version 5.4 and all the data is downloaded dynamically. In the Scene menu, under Solar System/ Heliosphere you will be able to find the assets. Under WSA Coronal Model 5.4 submenu you find additional fieldline options and solar surface options. For each asset, there are options for appearance as well as the option to save the downloaded content for next time, since the data is not cached on default. For the surfaces there are also diffrent layers to choose from. The white line shooting out from the Sun is always connected to the center of the Earth, along with the white arch. The yellow arch is the carrington prime meridian and the green grid is seperated with 10 degrees. Additionally, under the Actions panel you can find an option to toggle a white background. If no data is showing, most likely either files failed to download or time is set outside of data range. For more information on the simulation model, see https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/WSA~5.4.",
