    Description = "The WSA (Wang-Sheeley-Arge) model has 3 components.\nThe inner most from the photospheric surface (r = 1 solar radius) to a source surface (r = 2.5 solar radii) is a potential field source surface (PFSS) model of the inner coronal magnetic field. This ingests a map of the surface flux and constructs a potential field solution using a spherical harmonic expansion that matches the photospheric surface flux and also forces the solution to be radial at the source surface.\nThe second component is a pseudo-potential extension of the field solution from the source surface (2.5 solar radii) to 5 solar radii. This component is based on an approach first implemented by Schatten to add a realistic current sheet base and helmet streamer above the global neutral line, and is referred to as the Schatten Current Sheet (CS) component. It does this by temporarily forcing all radial field values to be positive, solving a potential field problem between 2.5 and 5 solar radii to match the solution from the inner PFSS component at 2.5 solar radiii, then correcting the sign of the radial field. By following this procedure, all fieldlines that are open at the source surface must remain open, but otherwise the field above 2.5 solar radii retains the lowest energy space filling characteristics of a potential field solution. This has the effect of creating a thin current sheet and a helmet streamer above the global neutral line. (Note: some non-radial smoothing of the shape of fieldlines is applied across the boundary between the inner PFSS component and the CS component to prevent unnatural cusps appearing in the fieldlines.)\nThe third and final component of the WSA model uses the field solution at 5 solar radii to generate a wind speed. The local wind speed is determined from an empirical formula which is a function of the local rate of expansion of the magnetic flux tube compared with that of a purely radial field, and on the distance of the photospheric footpoint of the local field line to the nearest coronal hole boundary.",
