  Description = [[
    This profile shows the Sun and its magnetic polarities, using data from the WSA model
    version 5.4. This model includes data for the solar surface as well as field lines.
    All data is downloaded dynamically, bringing you the latest data from the model.
    You can find these assets in the Scene menu under "Solar System/Heliosphere." Under
    the "WSA Coronal Model" submenu, you will find extra options for the solar field
    lines and surface features. The four different sets of field lines are all following
    the magnetic fields but traced from different locations. They can be colored by their
    different parameters in the data, for example polarity or open or closed field lines.
    The two elements named "Solar Surface" show the magnetic polarities, but have other
    options in the settings under "Surface Layer Options". Each asset includes settings
    for appearance, as well as an option to save the downloaded data for future use
    (by default, the data is not cached). Each data file remains active until the next
    one in the sequence becomes available. To see which file is currently being used,
    check the Texture Source field for each asset in the GUI. In the visualization, the
    white line shooting out from the Sun, along with the white arc, always points in
    the direction of Earth. The yellow arc is the Carrington prime meridian which is
    longitude 0 of the Sun, and the green grid shows lines with a 10-degree separation.
    You can also toggle a white background from the Actions panel. If no data is
    showing, most likely the selected time is outside of the data range (e.g., too far
    in the future or the past for the dynamic data to be available). Alternatively, the
    files failed to download. For more information on the simulation model, see
    https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/WSA~5.4.
