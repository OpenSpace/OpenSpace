  Description = [[Euclid is designed to explore the evolution of the dark universe. It will make a 3D-map of the universe (with time as the third dimension) by observing billions of galaxies out to 10 billion light-years, across more than a third of the sky.

  While dark energy accelerates the expansion of the universe and dark matter governs the growth of cosmic structures, scientists remain unsure about what dark energy and dark matter actually are.

  By observing the universe evolving over the past 10 billion years, Euclid will reveal how it has expanded and how structure has formed over cosmic history - and from this, astronomers can infer the properties of dark energy, dark matter and gravity, to reveal more about their precise nature.]],

      Description = [[Euclid was selected for implementation in June 2012 by ESA's Science Programme Committee. It's main scientific objectives are:

        - To investigate whether Dark Energy is real, or whether the apparent acceleration of the Universe is caused by a breakdown of General Relativity on the largest scales, or a failure of our assumption that the universe is more or less uniform in density.
        - If dark energy is real, to investigate whether it is a constant energy spread across space, which would make it the Cosmological Constant found in Einstein's General Relativity, or a new force of nature that evolves with the expansion of the Universe.
        - To investigate the nature of Dark Matter, the mass of neutrino particles and whether there are other, so-far undetected fast moving particle species in the Universe.
        - To investigate the conditions in the Universe after the Big Bang that seeded the large-scale structure of the universe that we observe today.]]
