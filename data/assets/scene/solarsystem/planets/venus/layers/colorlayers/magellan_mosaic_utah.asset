    Description = [[ Color layer for Venus. This mosaic was created from the Magellan
        F-BIDRs, (Full resolution Basic Image Data Records), the highest resolution
        radar images of the Venus surface (~75 m/pixel). Because Venus is shrouded by a
        dense, opaque atmosphere, conventional optical cameras cannot be used to image
        its surface. Instead, Magellan's imaging radar uses bursts of microwave energy
        somewhat like a camera flash to illuminate the planet's surface. The radar pulses
        are not sent directly downward but rather at a slight angle to the side of the
        spacecraft--the radar is thus called "side-looking radar." In addition, special
        processing techniques are used on the radar data to result in higher resolution
        as if the radar had a larger antenna, or "aperture"; the technique is thus often
        called "synthetic aperture radar," or SAR. The Magellan SAR is a side-looking
        radar system. Radar pulses are not sent directly downward but rather at a slight
        angle to the side of the spacecraft. In the case of Left-Look Magellan SAR data,
        the radar system was sending signals to the left of the spacecraft. The SAR
        operated in this left-looking mode during cycles 1 and 3 of the mission.
