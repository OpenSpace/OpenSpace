  Description = [[Color layer for Venus. This mosaic was created from the Magellan
    F-BIDRs, (Full resolution Basic Image Data Records), the highest resolution
    radar images of the Venus surface (~75 m/pixel). Because Venus is shrouded by a
    dense, opaque atmosphere, conventional optical cameras cannot be used to image
    its surface. Instead, Magellan's imaging radar uses bursts of microwave energy
    somewhat like a camera flash to illuminate the planet's surface. The radar pulses
    are not sent directly downward but rather at a slight angle to the side of the
    spacecraft--the radar is thus called "side-looking radar." In addition, special
    processing techniques are used on the radar data to result in higher resolution
    as if the radar had a larger antenna, or "aperture"; the technique is thus often
    called "synthetic aperture radar," or SAR. The Magellan SAR is a side-looking
    radar system. Radar pulses are not sent directly downward but rather at a slight
    angle to the side of the spacecraft. In the case of Left-Look Magellan SAR data,
    the radar system was sending signals to the left of the spacecraft. The SAR
    operated in this left-looking mode during cycles 1 and 3 of the mission.
