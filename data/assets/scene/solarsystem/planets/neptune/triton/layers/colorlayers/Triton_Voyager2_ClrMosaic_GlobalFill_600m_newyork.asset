  This map has a resolution of 1,970 feet (600 meters per pixel [m]). Color was synthesized by 
  combining high-resolution images taken through orange, violet, and ultraviolet filters; these 
  images were displayed as red, green, and blue images and combined to create this 
  color version (Smith et al., 1989).]],
