local Description = [[Geostationary satellites are a key tool for scientists to monitor
  and observe the Earth's atmosphere. They are called geostationary due to their movement.
  Geostationary satellites orbit around the Earth at the same rate as the Earth rotates so
  that the satellites are over the same spot on Earth all the time. This allows them to
  collect a continuous stream of data for one location so that "movies" of the data can be
  made. The satellites are positioned 22,300 miles above the Earth's surface in order to
  view the Earth's full disk and to maintain their geostationary orbit. Geostationary
  satellites travel at about 7000mph in order to maintain their geostationary orbit. Over
  the United States there are two such satellites, the GOES (Geostationary Operational
  Environmental Satellite) - East and GOES-West. There are many such satellites
  worldwide]]
