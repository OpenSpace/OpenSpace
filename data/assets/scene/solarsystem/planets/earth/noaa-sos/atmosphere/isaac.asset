local Description = [[Hurricane Isaac formed as a tropical depression east of the Lesser
Antilles on August 21 and that same day was upgraded to a tropical storm. As a tropical
storm Hurricane Isaac passed over Hispaniola and Cuba, killing many people. It them
entered the Gulf of Mexico. Shortly before making landfall near the mouth of the
Mississippi River, Tropical Storm Isaac strengthened and became Hurricane Isaac on August
28. Isaac actually made landfall twice, briefly returning offshore after its first
landfall before returning to land. Isaac was a very slow moving storm after landfall and
brought significant amounts of rain to the southeastern United States]]
