local Identifier = "noaa-sos-atmosphere-fossil_fuel"
local Description = [[This dataset shows the result of emitting carbon dioxide from
fossil fuel burning into the atmosphere over two years. A computer model of the
atmosphere called TM5 was used to create this powerful visualization. TM5 simulates the
movement of atmospheric gases globally, using winds and atmospheric mixing as derived
from the global weather forecast. The model has been used for the main greenhouse gases
carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), chemically active species
such as ozone (O3), and various aerosols. Like CarbonTracker, a measurement and modeling
system to keep track of carbon sources and sinks around the world, this dataset was
developed by the Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases group at NOAA's Earth System Research
Laboratory. Unlike CarbonTracker, this simulation does not use information from actual
observations and instead visualizes the transport of fossil fuel emissions.
Visualizations such as this dataset and CarbonTracker, aim to improve our understanding
of atmospheric carbon and how various sources and sinks may respond to the changing
climate, increasing levels of atmospheric CO2 (via the CO2 fertilization effect), and
human management of global resources]]
