local Description = [[Satellites are important to scientists because the instruments on
board can provide almost daily global coverage of the Earth that would otherwise not be
available. There are six instruments on board NASA's Aqua satellite. One of them is
MODIS, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. MODIS measures 36 spectral
frequencies of light, which provide a wealth of information about the physical properties
of the atmosphere and the biological and physical properties of the oceans and land. The
Aqua satellite with MODIS attached was launched May 4, 2002. Since then, Aqua has been
circling the Earth at an altitude of 438 miles (705 kilometers) every 99 minutes in a
polar orbit passing within 10 degrees of each pole every orbit. The orbit is
sun-synchronous, which means that the satellite passes over the same spot of the Earth at
about the same local time everyday. Aqua crosses the equator from south to north at about
1:30 pm local time]]
