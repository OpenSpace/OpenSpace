space. Because the Earth's rotational axis is at a 23Â° tilt, the Northern Hemisphere and
Southern Hemisphere simultaneously experience opposite seasons. This dataset displays the
gridded, monthly, historical terrestrial air temperature from 1950 - 1999. The original
data is from the Global Historical Climatology Network, which is part of NOAA's National
Climatic Data Center. The data was interpolated by the Center for Climatic Research at
the University of Delaware]]
