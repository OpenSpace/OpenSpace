local Description = [[ Hurricane Harvey was an extremely destructive Atlantic hurricane which became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. since Wilma in 2005. In a four-day period, many areas of eastern Texas received over 40 inches of rain as the system meandered along the gulf coast causing catastrophic flooding. With a record of 51.88 inches, Harvey is the wettest tropical hurricane on record in the contiguous U.S. The resulting floods inundated hundreds of thousands of homes, displaces more than 30,000 people, and prompted more than 17,000 rescues.  ]]
