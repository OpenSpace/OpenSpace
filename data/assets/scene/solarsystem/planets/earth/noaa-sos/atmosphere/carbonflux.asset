local Description = [[The Global Monitoring Division at NOAA diligently monitors carbon
dioxide and other trace gases in the atmosphere. One of the methods they use to sample
trace gases is collecting flasks of air from around the world that can be tested. They
have several other means for collecting samples as well. In this data set, the NOAA GMD
sampling network as of 2005 is portrayed. Circles are flask sampling locations, stars are
aircraft sites (12 flasks per flight are filled) and ships, which are only visible as
they race from Australia and New Zealand to the US west coast or Japan, or from Cape Town
to the US east coast. The coloration in the dataset represents the fluxes constructed by
the ocean, biosphere, and fossil fuel modules of the NOAA ESRL data assimilation system
for CO2 and related trace gases. The data set shows daily average fluxes constructed from
3-hour model output]]
