local Description = [[After a long lull in major hurricanes striking the U.S.
(2005 - 2017), the 2017 season was an extremely destructive season, featuring 17 named
storms in just the Atlantic Ocean, tying it with 1936 as the fifth-most active season
since records began in 1851. All ten of the Atlantic hurricanes occurred in a row, the
greatest number of consecutive hurricanes in the satellite era. In addition, it is by far
the costliest season on record, with a preliminary total of over $368.66 billion (USD) in
damages, which is more than double the cost of 2005's total, and nearly all of which was
due to three of the season's major hurricanes — Harvey, Irma, and Maria. All three
occurred within one month in August - September, sending disaster aide efforts reeling
and calling on volunteers for help]]
