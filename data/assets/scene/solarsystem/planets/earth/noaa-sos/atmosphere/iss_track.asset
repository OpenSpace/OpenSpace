local Description = [[The first piece of the International Space Station was sent into
  orbit in 1998. Following two more pieces, astronauts first entered the space station in
  November of 2000. Since then, the space station has been continuously inhabited by at
  least 2 people. The station is currently designed to house 3 crew members. The
  International Space Station is a cooperative space research facility being constructed
  cooperatively by many nations. Several space organizations had planned their own space
  stations and the groups decided to merge and work together. The original space station
  was a combination of NASA's Space Station Freedom, Russia's Mir-2, and the European
  Space Agency's Columbus. The project now involves NASA, the Russian Space agency, RKA;
  the European Space Agency, ESA; the Japanese Space agency, JAXA; and the Canadian Space
  agency, CSA]]
