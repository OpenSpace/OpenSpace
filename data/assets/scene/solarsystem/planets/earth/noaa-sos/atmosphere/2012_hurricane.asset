local Description = [[ "It was an extremely devastating and destructive storm, hopefully one that people will only see once in their lifetime," National Weather Service meteorologist, Joe Pollina, said of Hurricane Sandy. The 2012 Atlantic Hurricane season was tied with 1887, 1995, 2010 and 2011 as the third most active year in recorded history, producing nineteen tropical cyclones and named storms, ten hurricanes and two major hurricanes. Annual Atlantic hurricane predictions by NOAA and Colorado State University fell short of the actual numbers despite raising their numbers after a record active start to the season, which began on June 1st and ended on November 30th. The Eastern Pacific season was moderately active. This dataset names all the Atlantic and Pacific named tropical storms and hurricanes in 2012 from the Linear IR Satellite data recorded by geostationary satellites. ]]
