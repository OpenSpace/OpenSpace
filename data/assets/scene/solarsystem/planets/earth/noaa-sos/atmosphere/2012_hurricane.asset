one that people will only see once in their lifetime," National Weather Service
meteorologist, Joe Pollina, said of Hurricane Sandy. The 2012 Atlantic Hurricane season
was tied with 1887, 1995, 2010 and 2011 as the third most active year in recorded
history, producing nineteen tropical cyclones and named storms, ten hurricanes and two
major hurricanes. Annual Atlantic hurricane predictions by NOAA and Colorado State
University fell short of the actual numbers despite raising their numbers after a record
active start to the season, which began on June 1st and ended on November 30th. The
Eastern Pacific season was moderately active. This dataset names all the Atlantic and
Pacific named tropical storms and hurricanes in 2012 from the Linear IR Satellite data
recorded by geostationary satellites]]
