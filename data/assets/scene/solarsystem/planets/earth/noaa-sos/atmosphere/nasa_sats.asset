local Identifier = "noaa-sos-atmosphere-nasa_sats"
local Description = [[In order to enable coordinated science observations, the Earth
Observations System has created the A-Train. When finally completed in 2008, the A-Train
will consist of 6 polar-orbiting satellites that travel just minutes apart in a line.
Four of the satellites are NASA satellites, one is a French Centre National d'Etudes
Spatiales (CNES) satellite, and the other is a joint satellite between NASA and CNES. The
satellites have low polar orbits 438 miles (705 km) above Earth at an inclination of 98
degrees. Together, their overlapping science instruments give a comprehensive picture of
Earth weather and climate. The "A" in the A-Train is for "afternoon" because the lead
satellite, Aqua, crosses the equator at the mean local time of approximately 1:30pm. Five
of the satellites are currently in orbit, and the sixth satellite is scheduled to be
launched in 2008]]
