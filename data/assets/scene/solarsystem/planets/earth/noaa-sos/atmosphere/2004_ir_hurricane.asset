local Description = [[The 2004 hurricane season started on July 31 with Hurricane Alex
and continued all the way through to December 2 with Tropical Storm Otto. The season
featured 15 tropical storms, 9 of which became hurricanes, and 6 of those were classified
as major hurricanes. This over-active hurricane season tallied up a bill of $42 billion
in damages, which at the time was record high. Florida took the brunt of the damage with
4 major hurricanes making landfall in the state. Two of the hurricanes, Frances and
Jeanne, landed in almost the same location on the east coast of Florida only 3 weeks
apart. It is estimated that one in every five homes in Florida was damaged in the 2004
hurricane season]]
