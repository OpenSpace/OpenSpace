local Description = [[ Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas existing in the atmosphere at levels between 40 and 150 parts per billion (ppb). About 40% of that is produced by burning (combustion) of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) and biomass (for example, wood in forest fires). CO is the primary consumer of oxidant OH, the "cleansing agent" of the atmosphere. For example, OH "cleanses the air" by converting atmospheric methane (CH4) to CO2, which reduces its global warming potential because methane is a stronger greenhouse gas. OH also breaks down a whole host of other compounds such as benzene, isoprene and halocarbons, which would otherwise give rise to smog and reduce air quality. Therefore, an excess of atmospheric CO leads to a reduction of OH's cleansing capacity. Another reason for measuring CO concentrations is that it is an indicator of combustion, such as forest fires and urban emissions. A large forest fire or emissions from heavy traffic can produce CO concentrations of 200 - 5000 ppb. ]]
