local Description = [[Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas existing in the
atmosphere at levels between 40 and 150 parts per billion (ppb). About 40% of that is
produced by burning (combustion) of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) and biomass
(for example, wood in forest fires). CO is the primary consumer of oxidant OH, the
"cleansing agent" of the atmosphere. For example, OH "cleanses the air" by converting
atmospheric methane (CH4) to CO2, which reduces its global warming potential because
methane is a stronger greenhouse gas. OH also breaks down a whole host of other compounds
such as benzene, isoprene and halocarbons, which would otherwise give rise to smog and
reduce air quality. Therefore, an excess of atmospheric CO leads to a reduction of OH's
cleansing capacity. Another reason for measuring CO concentrations is that it is an
indicator of combustion, such as forest fires and urban emissions. A large forest fire or
emissions from heavy traffic can produce CO concentrations of 200 - 5000 ppb]]
