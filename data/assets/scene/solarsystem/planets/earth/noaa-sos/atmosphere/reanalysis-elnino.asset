local Description = [[ Until 2010, the longest globally-complete estimate of the 
four-dimensional atmospheric circulation was from a dataset produced jointly by NOAA's 
National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric 
Research: the NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis. This dataset of computer-generated weather map 
reconstructions or "reanalyses" starts from 1948, leaving many important climate events 
such as 1930's Dust Bowl drought uncovered. To expand the coverage of global gridded 
reanalyses, the 20th Century Reanalysis Project is an effort led by NOAA's Earth System 
Research Laboratory Physical Sciences Division and the University of Colorado CIRES 
Climate Diagnostics Center to produce a reanalysis dataset spanning the entire twentieth 
century, assimilating only surface observations of synoptic pressure, monthly sea surface 
temperature and sea ice distribution. The pressure observations have been assembled 
through international cooperation under the auspices of the Atmospheric Circulation 
Reconstructions over the Earth initiative, ACRE, and working groups of the Global Climate 
Observing System and World Climate Research Program. The Project uses a 
recently-developed Ensemble Filter data assimilation method which directly yields each 
six-hourly reanalysis field or weather map as the most likely state of the global 
atmosphere, and also estimates uncertainty in that map. This dataset will provide the 
first estimates of global tropospheric variability spanning 1871 to present at six-hourly 
temporal resolution and 2 degree longitude by 2 degree latitude resolution.   ]]
