local Description = [[ Satellites allow scientists to observe the Earth from above the atmosphere. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, has several different types of satellites, including geostationary and polar orbiting satellites. These datasets show the path of Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites, or POES for short. NOAA has two POES in operation currently, a morning and afternoon satellite. The morning satellite crosses the equator on the sun-light side of the Earth in the morning, and the afternoon satellite crosses in the afternoon. Both satellites orbit the Earth 14.1 times per day. ]]
