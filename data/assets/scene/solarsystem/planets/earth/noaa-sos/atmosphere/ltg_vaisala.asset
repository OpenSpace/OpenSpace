local Description = [[The Global Lightning Dataset GLD360 network detects between 1 and
3 million lightning events around the world every day of the year. Lightning activity is
not uniformly distributed across the globe. About ten times as many flashes occur over
land than over the oceans, and the majority of global lightning is concentrated in the
tropics. Over the course of a year, highest flash rate regions follow the inclination of
the sun. The northern hemisphere sees more activity during June through August; the
southern hemisphere has higher flash rates in January through March. These seasonal
patterns can be clearly seen in these images, which show the total number of events
detected in each month per square kilometer. The color scale ranges from less than .01
lightning pulses per square kilometer in the corresponding month to over 20 pulses per
square kilometer. Each color range corresponds to a factor of two of increase in the
number of events. This dataset runs from June 2011 through August 2012]]
