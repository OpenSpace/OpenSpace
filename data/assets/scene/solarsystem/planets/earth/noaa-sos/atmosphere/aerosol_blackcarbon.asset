local Identifier = "noaa-sos-atmosphere-aerosol-blackcarbon"
local Description = [[With so many uncertainties attached to climate change, it is
important to look at all of the factors. As early as 1896, scientists have been analyzing
the presence of black carbon in the atmosphere. This group of three datasets looks at the
presence of aerosols in the Earth's atmosphere. The first dataset contains only black
carbon optical thickness, the second has sulfate optical thickness and the third has a
combination of both black carbon and sulfate optical thickness. The data is from January
31, 2007 and extends out 120 hours through February 4, 2007. Black carbon is commonly
known as soot. It is generated from burning fossil fuels and biomass fuels. Soot is the
result of incomplete combustion, especially of coal, diesel fuels, biofuels and other
biomass burnings. Sulfate is the result of sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide interacting
with other compounds in the atmosphere. Sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere are associated
with the combustion of fossil fuels and also the eruption of volcanoes like Mt.
Pinatubo]]
