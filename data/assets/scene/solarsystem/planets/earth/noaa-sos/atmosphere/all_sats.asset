local Description = [[Satellites are a key tool for scientists to monitor and observe
the Earth's atmosphere from space. Geostationary satellites orbit around the Earth at the
same rate as the Earth rotates so that the satellites are over the same spot on Earth all
the time. This allows them to collect a continuous stream of data for one location so
that "movies" of the data can be made. The satellites are positioned 22,300 miles above
the Earth's surface in order to view the Earth's full disk and to maintain their
geostationary orbit. Geostationary satellites travel at about 7000mph in order to
maintain their geostationary orbit. In addition to geostationary satellites, scientists
also use polar orbiting satellites. These satellites circle the Earth, crossing the poles
on each orbit. Typically, polar orbiting satellites are about 500 miles above the Earth's
surface. The satellites travel at almost 17,000mph, allowing them to orbit the Earth in
roughly 100 minutes. A polar orbiting satellite is able to cover the whole Earth in less
than one day]]
