local Description = [[The Flow Following Finite Volume Icosahedral Model (FIM) was
developed by NOAA to produce weather forecasts. In fact, weather forecasts from the FIM
model are available for SOS here. Building upon the success of the FIM model, the
FIM-Chem model was created. The FIM-Chem is the FIM model with chemistry and aerosol
modules added. Aerosols are one of the biggest uncertainties in climate models due to
their varied affects on radiation and cloud physics. The FIM-Chem allows researchers to
forecast and study the behavior of aerosols in the atmosphere, leading to the potential
for better Earth system modeling for climate prediction]]
