local Description = [[ The Flow Following Finite Volume Icosahedral Model (FIM) was developed by NOAA to produce weather forecasts. In fact, weather forecasts from the FIM model are available for SOS here. Building upon the success of the FIM model, the FIM-Chem model was created. The FIM-Chem is the FIM model with chemistry and aerosol modules added. Aerosols are one of the biggest uncertainties in climate models due to their varied affects on radiation and cloud physics. The FIM-Chem allows researchers to forecast and study the behavior of aerosols in the atmosphere, leading to the potential for better Earth system modeling for climate prediction. ]]
