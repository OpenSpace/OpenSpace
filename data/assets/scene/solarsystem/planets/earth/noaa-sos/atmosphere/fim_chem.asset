local Description = [[The Flow Following Finite Volume Icosahedral Model (FIM) was 
developed by NOAA to produce weather forecasts. In fact, weather forecasts from the FIM 
model are available for SOS here. Building upon the success of the FIM model, the 
FIM-Chem model was created. The FIM-Chem is the FIM model with chemistry and aerosol 
modules added. Aerosols are one of the biggest uncertainties in climate models due to 
their varied affects on radiation and cloud physics. The FIM-Chem allows researchers to 
forecast and study the behavior of aerosols in the atmosphere, leading to the potential 
for better Earth system modeling for climate prediction]]
