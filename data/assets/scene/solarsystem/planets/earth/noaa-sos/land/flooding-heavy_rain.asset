local Description = [[Flooding is the nation's most common, costly and deadly natural
hazard. Heavy rain is the most frequent cause of floods, but there are many other natural
triggers, including hurricanes, tidal surges, ice jams and snow melt. Floods and flash
floods have happened in all 50 states in the USA. Flooding in river basins is a natural
part of the river's processes, serving to improve water quality and provide essential
habitat to species, among other benefits. Flooding is a matter of scientific interest, as
well as cultural significance, and is critical to land-use planning and policy. It is
also a vital concern to the safety and welfare of communities in flood prone areas
including those who live along waterways and coasts. People from all walks of life are
vulnerable to the effects of flooding]]
