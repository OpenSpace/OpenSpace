local Description = [[This planet Earth visualization shows a rotating planet in order
to display both a nighttime and daytime view. The daytime side of the visualization shows
the bathymetry and topography of the globe. Color coding is used to distinguish between
the elevations. Red and gray represent the highest terrain on the land, green and yellow
represent the lowest. In the ocean, the darker colors are the deeper ocean floors while
the lighter colors indicate shallower areas as well as mountain ranges on the sea floor.
The very light blue shading in the ocean, near the land forms, is generally the shallow
continental shelf. Some interesting features that can be seen are the mountain ranges in
the oceans, such as the mid-Atlantic Ridge in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, which is
spreading. Also in the ocean is the Marianas Trench, which is south of Japan. This trench
is the deepest location in the ocean with an amazing depth of 36,201 feet, almost 7
miles. On land, the Himalayas are a noteworthy feature, as they are the home of Mount
Everest, the tallest point on earth at a height of 29,035 feet, almost 5.5 miles]]
