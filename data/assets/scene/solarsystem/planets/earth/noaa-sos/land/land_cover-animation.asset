instrument on NASA's Terra satellite provides scientists with a new view of the Earth.
Using data collected by MODIS, researchers at Boston University were able to create these
land cover maps. Understanding the land cover of Earth aids policy makers involved in
natural resource management. The maps are also critical for scientists as they study
changes in the Earth system and as they model the Earth system. For example, in order to
calculate the carbon budget for the Earth system, scientists can use these maps to
determine the extent of vegetation covering the land surface that is absorbing carbon
dioxide. Each of the varying land types have different impacts on the Earth system. Snow
and ice cover cool the planet by reflecting sunlight back to space, forests absorb huge
amounts of carbon dioxide, and croplands and urban areas reflect the human impact on the
Earth]]
