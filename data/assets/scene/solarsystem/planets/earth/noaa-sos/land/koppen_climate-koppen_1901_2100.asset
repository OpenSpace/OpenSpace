local Description = [[Köppen climate classification is a widely used vegetation-based
empirical climate classification system developed by German botanist-climatologist
Wladimir Köppen. It's based on the idea that climate is best defined by native
vegetation. The formulas used in the classification correspond to those of the vegetation
zones (biomes) that were being mapped for the first time in the late 19th century. It was
first published in 1884 and was revised until 1940 with collaboration by German
climatologist Rudolf Geiger]]
