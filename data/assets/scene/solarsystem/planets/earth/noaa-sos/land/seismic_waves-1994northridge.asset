local Description = [[At 4:30 a.m. on January 17, 1994, the shaking of an earthquake
awakened 10 million people in the Los Angeles region of Southern California. The
earthquake's epicenter was in Northridge, CA, and it was a magnitude 6.7 shock that
proved to be the most costly earthquake in United States history. The shaking heavily
damaged communities throughout the San Fernando Valley and Simi Valley, and the
surrounding mountains north and west of Los Angeles, causing estimated losses of $20
billion. Fifty-seven people died, more than 9,000 were injured, and more than 20,000 were
displaced from their homes by the effects of the quake]]
