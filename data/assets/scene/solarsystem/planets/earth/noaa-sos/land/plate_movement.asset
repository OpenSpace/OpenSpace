local Description = [[Our planet's surface has been shaped and re-shaped by plate
tectonics through cycles of supercontinent amalgamation and breakup. We can study the
motion of the tectonic plates, and the continents that they carry, by measuring the
magnetic signatures recorded in rocks that form the seafloor. As plates move apart at mid
oceanic ridges (also known as seafloor spreading centers), lava from the Earth's mantle
fills the void that is being created and solidifies as basalt, which can capture the
magnetic polarity of the planet at the time. As the magnetic polarity reverses
irregularly over time, we can use this barcode pattern to determine the age of the
oceanic crust across all the world's oceans. Teams of geologists, geophysicists and
marine scientists use ocean-going scientific vessels to criss-cross the oceans in order
to reveal the entire "barcode" of seafloor spreading histories. This data enables the
creation of "plate tectonic reconstructions" where the seafloor spreading history can be
unwound to restore the past position of continents as they are pushed and pulled by the
motion of the oceanic plates]]
