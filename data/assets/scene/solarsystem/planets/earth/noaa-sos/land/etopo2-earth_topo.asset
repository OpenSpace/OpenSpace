local Description = [[Many datasets have been created by utilizing the ETOPO2 dataset,
which was generated from digital data bases of seafloor and land elevations on a 2-minute
latitude/longitude grid (1 minute of latitude = 1 nautical mile, or 1.15 statute mile).
The ETOPO2 is a combination of satellite altimetry observations, shipboard echo-sounding
measurements, data from the Digital Bathymetric Data Base Variable Resolution and data
from the GLOBE project which has a global digital elevation model. The topography and
bathymetry side of the Hot Topo dataset was created with this digital data base, as well
as the datasets EarthLiteColor, EarthOne, and Earth Land/Bathymetry. EarthOne and Earth
Land/Bathymetry are shaded in relatively true color, while Hot Topo and EarthLiteColor
use green, yellow, orange, red and white to denote increasing elevation of the land]]
