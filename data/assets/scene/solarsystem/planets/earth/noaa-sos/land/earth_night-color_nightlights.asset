local Description = [[The data was recorded by the Defense Meteorological Satellite
Program (DMSP) in the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), now part of NOAA National
Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The data was collected using polar orbiting
satellites that provide full cover of the globe twice a day. The satellites have an
Operation Linescan system which allows them to detect low levels of visible-near infrared
radiance at night. With this data, it is possible to detect clouds illuminated by
moonlight, lights from cities and towns, industrial sites, gas flares, fires, lightning,
and aurora. The Nighttime Lights of the World data set was complied from Defense
Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) data spanning October 1994 - March 1995]]
