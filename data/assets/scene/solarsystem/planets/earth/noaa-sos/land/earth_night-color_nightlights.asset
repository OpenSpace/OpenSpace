local Description = [[The data was recorded by the Defense Meteorological Satellite 
Program (DMSP) in the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), now part of NOAA National 
Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The data was collected using polar orbiting 
satellites that provide full cover of the globe twice a day. The satellites have an 
Operation Linescan system which allows them to detect low levels of visible-near infrared 
radiance at night. With this data, it is possible to detect clouds illuminated by 
moonlight, lights from cities and towns, industrial sites, gas flares, fires, lightning, 
and aurora. The Nighttime Lights of the World data set was complied from Defense 
Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) data spanning October 1994 - March 1995]]
