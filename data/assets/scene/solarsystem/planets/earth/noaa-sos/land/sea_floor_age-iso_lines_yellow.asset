local Description = [[The surface of the Earth is composed of a mosaic tectonic plates 
moving with respect to each other. The Earth is made of seven major plates and several 
smaller plates. As the plates move, new sea floor can be created. The plates form three 
different kinds of boundaries: convergent, divergent, and transform. Convergent 
boundaries are also called collision boundaries because they are areas where two plates 
collide. At transform boundaries, the plates slide and grind past one another. The 
divergent boundaries are the areas where plates are moving apart from one another. Where 
plates move apart, new crustal material is formed from molten magma from below the 
Earth's surface. Because of this, the youngest sea floor can be found along divergent 
boundaries, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ocean Ridge. The spreading, however, is generally 
not uniform causing linear features perpendicular to the divergent boundaries]]
