local Description = [[This dataset shows the Earth with daytime and nighttime views of
the Earth, to demonstrate how only half of the Earth is illumintated at one time. The
Blue Marble is an incredibly detailed, true-color depiction of the Earth, and is shown on
the daylight side of the Earth in this dataset. NASA is responsible for The Blue Marble,
made from a compilation of satellite images throughout 2001. Most of the information came
from NASA's MODIS, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, which is attached
to the Terra satellite 435 miles above Earth. The background image of the land and oceans
was created using data from June through September of 2001. This could not be done in a
single day or even a week because on any given day clouds are blocking a significant
portion of the surface. The cloud image is a composite of three days worth of data. The
first two days of data were collected in the visible wavelength and the third day was
needed to get a view of the clouds over the poles using thermal infrared imagery]]
