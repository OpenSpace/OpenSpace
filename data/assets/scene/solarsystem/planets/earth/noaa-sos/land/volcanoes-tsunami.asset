local Description = [[According to the Smithsonian Institute's Global Volcanism Program,
there are probably about 20 volcanoes erupting right now, and about 550 volcanoes have
had historically documented eruptions. A volcano is an opening, or rupture, in the
Earth's crust through which molten lava, ash, and gases are ejected. Volcanoes typically
form in three different settings. The first is divergent plate boundaries, where tectonic
plates are pulling apart from one another, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ocean Ridge. Most of
these volcanoes are on the bottom of the ocean floor and are responsible for creating new
sea floor. The second location is convergent plate boundaries, where two plates,
typically an oceanic and continental plate, are colliding. The volcanoes along the
Pacific Ring of Fire are from convergent plate boundaries. The third location is over
hotspots, which are typically in the middle of tectonic plates and caused by hot magma
rising to the surface. The volcanoes on Hawaii are the result of hotspots]]
