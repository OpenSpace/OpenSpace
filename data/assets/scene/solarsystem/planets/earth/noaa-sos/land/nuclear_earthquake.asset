local Description = [[Earthquakes have been occurring on Earth since its formation. They
occur when tectonic plates that are sliding against or past each other build up enough
tension to slip, causing the rock to settle into a new position and the ground to shake.
The United States Geological Survey predicts that 500,000 earthquakes happen every year,
although most go undetected because they are so small or so far away from populated
areas. 10,000 of them can be felt by humans and 100 of them cause damage. Unfortunately,
scientists have not yet discovered a reliably precise way to predict earthquakes, and
there is debate over whether such a thing is even possible. Current prediction methods
involve measuring the tension that has been bled off by past earthquakes and how often
earthquakes have occurred at that location before. Due to the fact that the instruments
that can measure tension and accurate seismographs are a recent invention, earthquake
prediction continues to be inaccurate and imprecise]]
