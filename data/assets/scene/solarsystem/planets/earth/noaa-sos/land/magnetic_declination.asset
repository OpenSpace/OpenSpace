local Description = [[Earth is like a giant magnet with a North and South Pole. However, 
the magnetic North and South Pole are not aligned with the Geographic North and South 
Pole. The Geographic North Pole is defined by the latitude 90Â° N and is the axis of the 
Earth's rotation. The Magnetic North Pole is where the Earth's magnetic field points 
vertically downward. The Earth creates its own magnetic field from the electric currents 
created in the liquid iron-nickel core]]
