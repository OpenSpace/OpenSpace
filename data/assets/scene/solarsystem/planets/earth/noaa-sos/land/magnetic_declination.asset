local Description = [[Earth is like a giant magnet with a North and South Pole. However,
the magnetic North and South Pole are not aligned with the Geographic North and South
Pole. The Geographic North Pole is defined by the latitude 90Â° N and is the axis of the
Earth's rotation. The Magnetic North Pole is where the Earth's magnetic field points
vertically downward. The Earth creates its own magnetic field from the electric currents
created in the liquid iron-nickel core]]
