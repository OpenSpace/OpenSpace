local Description = [[ These maps combine high-resolution daytime surface temperatures derived from satellite observations for both land and sea and display them with a common color scale. Displaying these high-resolution data with a common color scale makes evident the large difference between surface heating on land versus the sea. It also shows the relatively small seasonal variation in sea surface temperature over the globe relative to land temperatures. The larger seasonal variation in average temperature of the northern hemisphere relative to the southern hemisphere, a result of the larger land area in the northern hemisphere, is also evident.       ]]
