local Description = [[It is estimated that there are 500,000 detectable earthquakes in 
the world each year. Of those, 100,000 can be felt and 100 of them cause damage. Anything 
that causes seismic waves to radiate throughout the Earth is an earthquake. The cause of 
earthquakes can be natural, such as one tectonic plate slipping below another, or 
anthropogenic (cause by humans), such as drilling for fossil fuels, extraction of 
minerals, huge explosions, and the collapse of large buildings. Because most natural 
earthquakes occur due to slipping plates, the boundaries between tectonic plates are "hot 
spots" for earthquakes. In the Pacific Ocean, the Pacific Plate is referred to as the 
Ring of Fire because this is one of the most active plates where earthquakes and 
volcanoes frequently occur. In order to rate the strength and magnitude of earthquakes, 
the Richter magnitude scale was created. It is a base-10 logarithm scale of ground motion 
100km from the epicenter. Every whole-number increase in magnitude means the amplitude of 
the seismic wave is ten times greater. 4.0 - 4.9 on the scale is considered light, with 
some shaking of indoor items and significant damage unlikely]]
