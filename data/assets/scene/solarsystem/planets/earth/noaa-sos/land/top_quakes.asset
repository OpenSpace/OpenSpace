local Description = [[It is estimated that there are 500,000 detectable earthquakes in
the world each year. Of those, 100,000 can be felt and 100 of them cause damage. Anything
that causes seismic waves to radiate throughout the Earth is an earthquake. The cause of
earthquakes can be natural, such as one tectonic plate slipping below another, or
anthropogenic (cause by humans), such as drilling for fossil fuels, extraction of
minerals, huge explosions, and the collapse of large buildings. The surface of the Earth
is composed of a mosaic of tectonic plates moving with respect to each other. When two
plates glide past one another, a stress builds up at the boundary. When that stress
reaches a critical level, the boundary slips and the result is an earthquake. Because
most natural earthquakes occur due to slipping plates, the boundaries between tectonic
plates are "hot spots" for earthquakes. The magnitude of earthquakes is measured by the
Richter magnitude scale. It is a base-10 logarithm scale of the ground motion caused by
the earthquake. Each increase of 1 in magnitude represents 10 times more ground
motion]]
