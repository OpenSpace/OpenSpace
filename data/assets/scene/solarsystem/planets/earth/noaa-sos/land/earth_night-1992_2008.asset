Program (DMSP) in the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), now part of NOAA National 
Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The data was collected using polar orbiting 
satellites that provide full cover of the globe twice a day. The satellites have an 
Operation Linescan system which allows them to detect low levels of visible-near 
infrared radiance at night.   ]]
