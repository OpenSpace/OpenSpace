Program (DMSP) in the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), now part of NOAA National
Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The data was collected using polar orbiting
satellites that provide full cover of the globe twice a day. The satellites have an
Operation Linescan system which allows them to detect low levels of visible-near
infrared radiance at night]]
