local Description = [[Earth is like a giant magnet with a North and South Pole. However,
the magnetic North and South Pole are not aligned with the Geographic North and South
Pole. The Geographic North Pole is defined by the latitude 90° N and is the axis of the
Earth's rotation. The Magnetic North Pole is where the Earth's magnetic field points
vertically downward. The Earth creates its own magnetic field from the electric currents
created in the liquid iron-nickel core. In order to illustrate the earth's magnetic
field, three datasets for Earth's Magnetism have been created. All of these datasets show
the changes in the magnetic field from 1590 - 2010. The first dataset shows the magnetic
field lines at the surface of the Earth. The magnetic poles are indicated by stars. The
blue lines show where the magnetic field dips into the Earth and the red lines show where
the magnetic field emerges from the Earth. Where the field lines are horizontal to the
Earth, between the red and blue lines, is the magnetic equator shaded yellow]]
