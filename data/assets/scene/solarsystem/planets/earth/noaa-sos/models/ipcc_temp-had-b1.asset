established by WMO and UNEP to assess scientific, technical and socio- economic
information relevant for the understanding of climate change, its potential impacts and
options for adaptation and mitigation. It is open to all members of the UN and of WMO."
- from www.ipcc.ch. In an effort to better visualize the future of climate change, the
IPCC releases assessment reports on the current state of the atmosphere and what the
future could hold. Models from various atmospheric and oceanic organizations are included
in these reports in order to establish a broad understanding of the science. Data from
three of the IPCC models following temperature change from 1870 - 2100 have been
formatted for Science On a Sphere]]
