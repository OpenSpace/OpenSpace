local Description = [[The Earth has been through many changes and continues to change
today. To better understand these changes, the Zürich University of Applied Sciences
created a simulation using past climate data, observations, and computer models. The
simulation starts 21,000 years ago and ends 8,000 years in the future, showing the
changes in ice concentration, sea level, and vegetation. 19,000BC was chosen as the start
date because this was the last glacial maximum, when the Earth's ice sheets were at their
maximum extension. As seen in the animation, much of northern Europe and North America
were covered in ice in 19,000BC. The labels for the animation include information about
carbon dioxide concentration, average temperature, sea level and population. The red line
indicates the current levels. The yellow borders on the map represent the current
coastlines. The data from 19,000BC to 2,000AD includes the most up-to-date paleoclimate
data that is available. A list of sources can be found here. Some notable events in the
past simulation include:

The North Sea quickly forms around 8,000BC, creating the British Isles
"Mega-Lake Chad" forms in the present-day Saraha Desert and is surrounded by lush
landscapes around 7,000BC
The ice pulls back and North America and Europe are largely ice free, starting in 6,500BC
The lush vegetation across Northern Africa and the Arabian peninsula retreats in 2,000BC

For the time frame from 2,000AD to 3,000AD, a computer model based on the IPCC A2
scenario was used. This scenario assumes a complete cessation of carbon dioxide emissions
in 2100. More details on the model used can be found here. In this part of the simulation
the time steps change from a frame every 500 years as used in the first part of the
animation, to a frame every 50 years to show the rapid changes that are modeled. The
northern ice cap quickly disappears and the ice on Greenland and Antarctica begins to
melt steadily. By the year 3,000AD, there is predicted 6m (19ft) sea level rise. The
simulation continues from 3,000AD to 10,000 AD in 500 year time steps in a fictional
scenario of worldwide glacier meltdown and shows the impacts this would have on the
coasts]]
