local Description = [[From tourism to disease prevention, it's clear that reefs offer
much more than recreation. According to the newly released Reefs at Risk Revisited
report, coral reefs:

Support more than 275 million people worldwide.
Protect coastlines in more than 100 countries - helping defend against storms and erosion.
Accounts for 15% of gross domestic product in more than 20 countries.
Hold the potential to fight disease - including treatments for cancer, HIV, malaria, and
other diseases.

Yet coral reefs today face serious threats. The new report finds that approximately 75%
of world's coral reefs are currently threatened by local and global pressures. Local
pressures pose the most immediate threat - especially from overfishing and destructive
fishing, which is particularly widespread in Southeast Asia. Global threats from climate
change and alterations in ocean chemistry (i.e. ocean acidification) are compounding the
pressures on reefs. Climate change is causing ocean temperatures to rise, which, in turn,
is leading to wide-spread coral bleaching]]
