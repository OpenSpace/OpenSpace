local Description = [[ Though satellites provide highly detailed analyses of the temperature of the ocean surface, they cannot measure temperatures below the first 1 mm of water. For that deeper understanding, NOAA relies on thousands of buoys, ships, undersea gliders and other devices to measure temperatures at depth. The measurements are consolidated every few years by the National Oceanographic Data Center into a product known as the World Ocean Atlas. The measurements shown here go as deep as 5,000 m — far deeper than many places in the ocean — which is why there is a lack of data (black areas) in some of the deeper imagery. ]]
