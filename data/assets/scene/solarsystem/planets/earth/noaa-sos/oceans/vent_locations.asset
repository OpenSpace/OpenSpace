local Description = [[This dataset shows all known locations of deep-sea hydrothermal 
vents. Hydrothermal vents form in places where there is volcanic activity, such as along 
Earth's plate boundaries. They occur when seawater seeps down and is heated deep beneath 
the seafloor. The hot fluid rises and gushes out of vents at temperatures up to 400 deg C 
(more than 750 deg F!), carrying with it chemical energy that supports life in the 
otherwise cold, dark, deep sea]]
