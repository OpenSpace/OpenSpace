Out of this came the Tagging of the Pacific Pelagics Project. Pelagaics are open ocean species such as sea birds and elephant seals. Scientists put satellite tags on animals that collect information about position, ocean temperature, pressure, salinity and more! This allows scientists to better understand the migration patterns and habits of these animals. ]]
