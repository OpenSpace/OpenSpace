local Description = [[Arctic sea ice extent is declining at a rapid rate; the extent in
September, 2019 was about 30% lower than the average September extent over 1980-2010. Sea
ice in both hemispheres can be easily monitored now, with data from a series of
satellites that have been operating since the late 1970s. Every year, NOAA publishes the
Arctic Report Card. In it, scientists summarize how sea ice, along with snow cover,
tundra greenness, marine algae, caribou, and other indicators of change are responding to
warming that is taking place about two times faster in the Arctic than elsewhere on the
planet]]
