local Description = [[At 3:34 on the morning of February 27, 2010 (06:34 UTC), an 8.8 
moment magnitude earthquake struck near the coastline of central Chile. The Pacific 
Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) quickly determined that the large magnitude of this 
earthquake, its location near the coastline, its relatively shallow depth within the 
earth, and a history of megathrust earthquakes in the region meant that it could have 
moved the seafloor and thus posed a significant tsunami risk and PTWC issued their first 
tsunami warning several minutes later for Chile and Peru. The earthquake did in fact 
cause a tsunami, and over the following hours as PTWC learned more about the earthquake 
(confirming it was a megathrust and upgrading its magnitude) and its tsunami through 
forecast models and direct observation with DART sensors and coastal sea-level gauges 
PTWC would eventually issue tsunami warnings to the State of Hawaii and all 43 countries 
and territories participating the Pacific Tsunami Warning System, keeping warnings in 
some areas in effect for more than a day. PTWC's sister office, the West Coast and Alaska 
Tsunami Warning Center (now known as the National Tsunami Warning Center), also issued 
tsunami advisories for Alaska and the Pacific coasts of the United States and Canada. The 
tsunami caused the greatest devastation and 124 deaths in Chile, where waves reached as 
high as 29 m or 95 ft. on the mainland, over 18 m or 60 ft. in its Juan Fernandez 
Islands, and over 4 m or 14 ft. at Rapa Nui (Easter Island). Outside of Chile tsunami 
wave heights exceeded 1 m or 3 ft. in the Marquesas Islands (French Polynesia), New 
Zealand, the Kuril Islands (Russia), and in the United States in California and Hawaii, 
and caused minor damage in San Diego, California and in Japan]]
