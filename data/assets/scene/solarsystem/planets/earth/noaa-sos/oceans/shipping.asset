local Description = [[There were more than 30,000 merchant ships greater than 1000 gross
tonnage at sea in 2005. The World Meteorological Organization has a Voluntary Observing
Ships Scheme that equips ships with weather instruments in order to provide observations
for weather models and forecasters. In addition to observing the weather, the location of
the ships is also recorded through GPS. From October 2004 through October of 2005
1,189,127 mobile ship data points were collected from 3,374 commercial and research
vessels, which is about 11% of all ships at sea in 2005. By connecting the data points
for each vessel, shipping routes over the course of one year were plotted. The National
Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis compiled this data to include in their
Global Map of Human Impacts to Marine Ecosystems]]
