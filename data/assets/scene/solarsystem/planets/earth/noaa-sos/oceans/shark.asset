local Description = [[Before satellite tagging technology became feasible, it was
thought that great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), spent most of their time close
to the coasts feeding on seals and sea lions. With the advent of satellite tagging
technology, many new behaviors of the great white shark have been discovered. By tagging
a shark with a satellite transmitter, scientists are able to track the movement of the
shark for extended periods. In 2001, a shark tagged off of the coast of California was
tracked all the way to Hawaii, 3,800 km (2,280 miles) away. The shark spent the winter
there before returning to waters closer to California. Several other sharks tagged off
the coast of California also were tracked traveling great distances from California]]
