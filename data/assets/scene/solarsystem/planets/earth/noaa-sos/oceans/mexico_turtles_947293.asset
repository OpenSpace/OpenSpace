local Description = [[Three Kemp's ridley sea turtles were captured near the Calcasieu
Pass jetties at Cameron, Louisiana and tracked by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service Galveston Laboratory. Two adult
females (94-7293 and 94-7295) were captured on 11 August 1994 in a turtle entanglement
net by Texas A&M University biologists. Turtle 94-7293's shell measured 65.6 cm in length
and 64.9 cm in width, and weighed 84.4 pounds (38.3 kg). Turtle 94-7295's shell measured
65.8 cm in length and 64.9 cm in width, and weighed 93.9 pounds (42.6 kg). Both were
fitted with Telonics ST-10 satellite transmitters and released within 2 days at the
capture site]]
