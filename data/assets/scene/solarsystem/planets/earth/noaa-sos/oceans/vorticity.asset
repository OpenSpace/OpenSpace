local Description = [[ This animation shows daily values of the ocean surface relative vorticity as simulated by the Parallel Ocean Program (POP). Vorticity, which can be thought of as the rate of fluid rotation, is particularly useful for visualizing ocean turbulent flow, highlighting the presence of swirling eddies. A significant amount of the total kinetic energy in the world ocean is attributable to these turbulent motions, making them an important component in balances of energy, momentum, heat, salt, and chemical constituents (such as carbon dioxide) throughout the globe. ]]
