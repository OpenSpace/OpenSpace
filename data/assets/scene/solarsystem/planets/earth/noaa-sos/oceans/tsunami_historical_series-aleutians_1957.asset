local Description = [[At 4:22 am on Saturday, March 9, 1957 (9 March, 14:22 Z UTC) the
second great earthquake in 11 years struck Alaska's Aleutian Islands. This earthquake had
the same magnitude of the earlier earthquake--8.6 on the moment magnitude scale (Johnson
et al. 1994)--but was to the west of the 1946 earthquake, near the Andreanof Islands. As
with the earlier event it also caused a dangerous tsunami that caused significant damage
in the Aleutian Islands and in Hawaii and was observed as far away as Chile. The greatest
wave heights were in Alaska's Aleutian Islands, with waves nearly 23 m or 75 ft. high
coming ashore on Unimak Island. The tsunami would reach Hawaii a little over four hours
later, with the largest waves striking the island of Kauai at over 11 m or 38 ft. high
and would cause $5.3 million in damage statewide ($46 million in 2017), including the
destruction of more than 80 homes. Elsewhere around the Pacific Ocean the tsunami waves
would reach heights of 6 m or 20 ft. in the Marquesas Islands (French Polynesia), 3 m or
10 ft. in Japan, 1.5 m or 5 ft. in American Samoa, and over 1 m or 3 ft. in Mexico and
Chile. Unlike the earlier event, however, it did not kill any people thanks to effective
tsunami alerts from to the Honolulu Observatory and the Seismic Sea Wave Warning System.
These efforts, established in 1948, would later become the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center
(PTWC) and Pacific Tsunami Warning System]]
