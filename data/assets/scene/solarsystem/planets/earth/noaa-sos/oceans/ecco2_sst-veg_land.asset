local Description = [[ To increase understanding and predictive capability for the oceanâ€™s role in future climate change scenarios, the NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction (MAP) program has created a project called Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II (ECCO2): High-Resolution Global-Ocean and Sea-Ice Data Synthesis. ECCO2 produces increasingly accurate syntheses of all available global-scale ocean and sea-ice data at resolutions that start to resolve ocean eddies and other narrow current systems, which transport heat, and other properties within the ocean. ECCO2 data syntheses are created by using the available satellite and in-situ data in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MIT GCM). ECCO2 simulates ocean flows at all depths, but only surface flows are used in this visualization. The global sea surface current flows are colored by corresponding sea surface temperatures. The sea surface temperature data is also from the ECCO2 model. ]]
