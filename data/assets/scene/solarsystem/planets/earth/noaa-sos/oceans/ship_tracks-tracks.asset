local Description = [[ Beneath the sea surface is an amazing sea floor that contains 
mountain ranges, trenches and plains. The ocean covers 71% of the Earth's surface, has an 
area of 139,400,000 square miles and an average depth of 2.3 miles. The first 
measurements of the sea floor were made with weighted lines that were lowered until they 
hit the bottom. Vast improvements have been made since that time, yet the majority of the 
sea floor remains unmapped. It's important to know the bathymetry, or the sea floor 
terrain, of the ocean for navigation and exploration purposes. Today, bathymetric maps 
are created using data from multibeam echosounders. A multibeam echosounder is a device 
that is mounted to the hull of a ship to determine the depth of water and the nature of 
the seabed. The system emits a broad acoustic pulse from under a ship and then records 
how long it takes the beams to return to the ship after bouncing off the sea floor. If 
the speed of sound in water is known for the full water column, then the depth of the sea 
floor can be calculated from the travel time. Multiple beams are sent out in a fan 
shape to collect depth information in a swath beneath the boat as it travels through the 
ocean.   ]]
