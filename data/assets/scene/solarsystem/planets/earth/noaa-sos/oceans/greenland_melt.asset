local Description = [[Changes in the climate around Greenland can have a world-wide
effect. According to Dr. Konrad Steffen, professor of geography at the University of
Colorado and director of the NOAA joint institute CIRES, "For every degree (F) increase
in the mean annual temperature near Greenland, the rate of sea level rise increases by
about 10 percent." As Greenland warms, the ice that covers it melts and flows into the
oceans. In order to study melting trends on Greenland, researchers at NASA developed a
"melt index" which is the number of days that melting occurred multiplied by the melting
area. There is a steady increase in the melt index from 1988 through present. In fact,
in 2006 Greenland experienced more days of melting snow and at higher altitudes than the
average over the past 18 years that have been studied]]
