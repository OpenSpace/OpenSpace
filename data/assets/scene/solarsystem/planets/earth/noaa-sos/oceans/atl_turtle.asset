local Description = [[The Virginia Institute of Marine Science found a sub-adult
juvenile loggerhead (Caretta caretta) sea turtle stranded off of Deltaville, Virginia
along the western Chesapeake Bay in July 2004. The sea turtle, appropriately named Delta
for the location where s/he was found stranded, had a broken left flipper and a severe
head injury most likely from a collision with a boat propeller. Delta was transferred to
the Virginia Aquarium Stranding Program for rehabilitation. After many months of recovery
and head surgery, Delta was ready for release in November of 2004. Before release, Delta
was outfitted with a satellite tag by Kate Mansfield, then a Ph.D. student at the
  Virginia Institute of Marine Science (College of William and Mary). This was done in
  order to track Delta's movements and determine the success of the recovery]]
