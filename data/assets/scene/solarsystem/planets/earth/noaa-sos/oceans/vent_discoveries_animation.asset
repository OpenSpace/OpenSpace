local Description = [[This dataset is an animation showing the discoveries of deep-sea
hydrothermal vents from 1977-2016 (cumulative, annually). In 1977 scientists made a
stunning discovery that changed our understanding of life on Earth. On the deep seafloor
they had discovered hot springs, or hydrothermal vents, with animals that had never been
seen before. These discoveries continue today. Over 240 vent fields have been discovered
with human-occupied, remotely-operated, and autonomous vehicles]]
