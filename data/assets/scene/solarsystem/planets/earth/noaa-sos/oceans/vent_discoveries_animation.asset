In 1977 scientists made a stunning discovery that changed our understanding of life on Earth. On the deep seafloor they had discovered hot springs, or hydrothermal vents, with animals that had never been seen before. These discoveries continue today. Over 240 vent fields have been discovered with human-occupied, remotely-operated, and autonomous vehicles.  ]]
