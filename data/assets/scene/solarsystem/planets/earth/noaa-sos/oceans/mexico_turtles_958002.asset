local Description = [[These three Kemp's ridley sea turtles were captured near the
Calcasieu Pass jetties at Cameron, Louisiana and tracked by National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service Galveston
Laboratory. Two adult females (94-7293 and 94-7295) were captured on 11 August 1994 in a
turtle entanglement net by Texas A&M University biologists. Turtle 94-7293's shell
measured 65.6 cm in length and 64.9 cm in width, and weighed 84.4 pounds (38.3 kg).
Turtle 94-7295's shell measured 65.8 cm in length and 64.9 cm in width, and weighed 93.9
pounds (42.6 kg). Both were fitted with Telonics ST-10 satellite transmitters and
released within 2 days at the capture site]]
