local Description = [[Climate change may pose a significant threat to fisheries
resources globally. This dataset shows percent change in global fisheries catch projected
to occur by 2050 due to climate change. Comparison is made with fisheries catch levels
reported in 2005. This study suggests that the distribution of major fish stocks will
shift because of climate change as ocean temperature changes. Areas in orange experience
reduced fisheries catch while areas in blue experience higher fisheries catch. The
general pattern is a poleward shift in potential fisheries catches - that is fish
distributions will shift to higher latitude areas (towards poles) and cooler waters as
ocean temperatures increase. The study also predicts species extinction to occur in areas
where species are most sensitive to temperature changes, resulting in reduced fisheries
catch in these areas]]
