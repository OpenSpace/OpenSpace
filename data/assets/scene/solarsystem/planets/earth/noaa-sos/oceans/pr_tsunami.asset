local Description = [[After the devastation of the Indian Ocean Tsunami on December 26,
2004, much attention has been given to tsunami research. The National Center for Tsunami
Research, which is part of the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, spearheaded the
research efforts in the United States. A tsunami is a series of waves generated when a
body of water, such as the ocean, is rapidly displaced on a massive scale. This is most
likely to happen where the tectonic plates meet and create trenches. An earthquake in
these regions can cause one plate to subduct under another and displace huge amounts of
water. One location that has garnered much attention from scientists is the Puerto Rico
Trench, the deepest location in the Atlantic Ocean]]
