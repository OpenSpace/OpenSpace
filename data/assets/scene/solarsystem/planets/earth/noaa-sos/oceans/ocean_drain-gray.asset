mountain ranges, trenches and plains. The ocean covers 71% of the Earth's surface, has an
area of 139,400,000 square miles and an average depth of 2.3 miles. Due to this vast
size, only a few percent the sea floor has been mapped by ships. Maps of the sea floor
are created by combining soundings from ships, sonar scans from ships, and gravity
anomalies in the sea surface detected by satellites]]
