local Description = [[On April 1, 1946 at 4:28 am (12:28 UTC), an 8.6 moment magnitude
earthquake struck off the coast of Unimak Island in Alaska's Aleutian Islands,
generating a tsunami that caused the greatest damage and number of deaths in Hawaii's
history, leading to the creation of the United States' first tsunami warning system. As
is typical for dangerous tsunamis the greatest wave heights were nearest the epicenter.
The waves reached as high as 42 m or about 138 ft. on Unimak Island and destroyed its
lighthouse and killed the five people there. Elsewhere this tsunami caused the greatest
damage and number of deaths on inhabited Pacific islands. In Hawaii the waves reached
about 17 m or 55 ft. high and killed 158 people, most in the town of Hilo, while in the
Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia the waves reached even higher to 20 m or 65 ft but
killed only two people. Chile's Easter Island also got nearly 9 m or 28 ft.while its Juan
Fernandez Islands got nearly 3 m or 9 ft. high waves. Pitcairn Island also had 5 m or 16
ft. high waves, New Zealand had over 2 m or 8 ft. high waves, and Samoa had over 1 m or
about 4 ft. high waves. In North America the highest waves were in California at over 2 m
or over 8 ft. and killed one person there and in South America it killed one more person
in Peru]]
