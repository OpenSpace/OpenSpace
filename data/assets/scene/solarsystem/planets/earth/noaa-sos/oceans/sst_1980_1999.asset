local Description = [[Rather than plotting sea surface temperatures, sea surface
temperature anomalies have been plotted here to show the dramatic departures from normal
that are associated with El Nino and La Nina from 1980 - 1999. El Nino is the warming of
the Pacific Ocean off of the western coast of South America near Ecuador and Peru. It is
called El Nino, or little boy in Spanish, referring to the Christ child because the
phenomena usually occurs near Christmas time. The opposite of El Nino is La Nina, or
little girl in Spanish, which is a cooling of the Pacific Ocean. The red shading
signifies a warming of the ocean by 5-10°F, the green shading is normal and the blue
shading is a cooling of the ocean by 5-10°F]]
