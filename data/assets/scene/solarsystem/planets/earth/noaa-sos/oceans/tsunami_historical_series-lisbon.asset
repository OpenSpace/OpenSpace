local Description = [[ On the morning of November 1, 1755, a great earthquake shook 
Portugal's capital city of Lisbon as worshipers filled churches and cathedrals for the 
All Saints' Day Mass. In seconds it left the city in ruins and in minutes those ruins 
were on fire. The earthquake probably killed about 30,000 people, though some estimates 
double that figure. Many of the survivors fled to the wharves and keys of Lisbon's port, 
but they would find no safety there. The first tsunami wave surged up the Tagus estuary 
about an hour after the earthquake, reached a maximum runup of 12 meters (40 feet), and 
killed another 1000 people. At least two more tsunami waves surged into the city, 
completing the earthquake's destruction.   ]]
