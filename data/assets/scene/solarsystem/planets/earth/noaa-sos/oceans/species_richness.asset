local Description = [[Species richness is a count of the number of different species in
an ecological community, landscape or region. Species richness is one of several
measurements used by scientists to help determine how biologically rich and diverse a
given area is. This map shows the predicted global distribution of 1066 commercially
harvested marine fish and invertebrates. Areas on the map with brighter colors
(orange/yellow) highlight areas with greater number of different species (higher species
richness), while cooler colors (purple) areas with lower number of species (lower species
richness). The map shows the highest number of different species is concentrated along
the coasts. These coastal areas are also where we find our largest marine ecosystems,
such as coral reefs, mangroves and marshes, which provide food and shelter for
economically, culturally, and ecologically important marine species. This stresses the
importance of protecting critical habitat along our coasts for marine life and
fisheries]]
