local Description = [[It is common for scientists to tag animals and release them into
their natural environment in order to study their behaviors and migration. Adelita, a
loggerhead (Caretta caretta) sea turtle, was originally captured off of Baja, Mexico as
an 8-pound juvenile. After being raised in captivity, Adelita was released on August 10,
1996 from Santa Rosaliita, a small town in Mexico on the Baja Peninsula. Adelita weighed
223 pounds when she was released. Before she was released, Wallace J. Nichols, then a
Ph.D. student at the University of Arizona, outfitted Adelita with a satellite tag. The
tag transmitted a signal that allowed Adelita's track to be monitored post-release]]
