local Description = [[The ocean has an impact on the lives of everyone on Earth, even
those who don't live on the coasts. It has been estimated that one in every six jobs in
the United States is marine-related and that 50% of all species on Earth are supported by
the ocean. Because of this, it is important to protect and preserve the oceans. Humans
however have been shown to have a negative impact on the oceans. A report issued in
February 2008 found that 40% of the world's oceans are heavily impacted by human
activities, such as overfishing and pollution. In all 17 different human activities were
examined in the report, including fertilizer run-off, commercial shipping, and indirect
activities such as changes in sea surface temperature, UV radiation, and ocean
acidification]]
