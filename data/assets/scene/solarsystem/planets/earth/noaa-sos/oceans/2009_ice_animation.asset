local Description = [[ Sea ice is simply ocean water that has frozen. At least 15% of the ocean is covered by sea ice some part of the year. This means that on average, sea ice covers almost 10 million square miles (about 25 million square kilometers) of the Earth. Sea ice concentrations are monitored closely by scientists because changing sea ice concentrations can have a huge impact on the rest of the globe. Global warming is amplified in polar regions. Because of this, monitoring changes in sea ice can be a good indicator of climate change. The Global Snow and Ice Cover Map that is used in this dataset is created from a combination of observations from NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer, Meteosat Second Generation Satellite Spectral Response Characterisation, GOES Imager and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Special Sensor Microwave/Imager. The resolution is 2 km. ]]
