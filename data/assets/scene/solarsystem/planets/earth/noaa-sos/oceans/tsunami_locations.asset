local Description = [[Earthquakes, landslides, volcanoes, explosions, and atmospheric
processes - all of these disasters have caused tsunamis in the past. But by far, the most
common generator of tsunamis is earthquakes, as has recently been seen in Sumatra, Chile,
and Japan. The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center archives academic and historical
reports from around the world of where tsunamis are estimated to have originated, and
have compiled a database of over 2,500 events from 2,000 B.C. through 2014t. This image
plots about half of those events - tsunamis that are classified as a "definite tsunami"
or "probable tsunami." The icons are shaded according to the devastation of the event by
the number of fatalities caused where white = none, yellow = 1-50, orange = 51-100, and
red = >101. Since earthquakes are the most common tsunami generator, the highest density
of event origins are located around the Pacific "Ring of Fire" known for its prevalence
of volcanic and tectonic activity. The points are overlaid on top of a map of ocean
bathymetry (Natural Earth 2 from the Natural Earth project), which indicates many of the
pronounced ocean features, such as volcanic islands, rift zones, and plate boundaries
 that are often associated with generating tsunamis]]
