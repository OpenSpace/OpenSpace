local Description = [[ Processes that took place through Earth's history, such as the weathering of rocks, evaporation of ocean water, and the formation of sea ice, have made the ocean salty. Those are still at work today and are counterbalanced by processes that decrease the salt in the ocean, like freshwater input from rivers, precipitation, and the melting of ice. The result is an ocean surface where the salinity - the concentration of salt - changes and these changes, small as they may be, have large-scale effects on Earth's water cycle and ocean circulation.]]
