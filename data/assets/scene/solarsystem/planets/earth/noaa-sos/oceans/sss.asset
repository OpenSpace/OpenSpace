local Description = [[Processes that took place through Earth's history, such as the
weathering of rocks, evaporation of ocean water, and the formation of sea ice, have made
the ocean salty. Those are still at work today and are counterbalanced by processes that
decrease the salt in the ocean, like freshwater input from rivers, precipitation, and the
melting of ice. The result is an ocean surface where the salinity - the concentration of
salt - changes and these changes, small as they may be, have large-scale effects on
Earth's water cycle and ocean circulation]]
