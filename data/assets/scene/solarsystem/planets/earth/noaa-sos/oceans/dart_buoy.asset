local Description = [[After the horrific events of the Indian Ocean Tsunami on December
26, 2004, the need for a tsunami warning system was apparent. As part of the U.S.
National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP), the Deep Ocean Assessment and
Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) Project is an ongoing effort to maintain and improve the
capability for the early detection and real-time reporting of tsunamis in the open ocean.
Developed by NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) and operated by NOAA's
National Data Buoy Center (NDBC), DART is essential to fulfilling NOAA's national
responsibility for tsunami hazard mitigation and warnings. When completed in mid2007, the
DART Project will consist of 32 DART buoys]]
