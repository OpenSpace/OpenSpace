local Description = [[There are many questions surrounding climate change. One big
question is how the changing climate will affect the oceans. The sea level has been
steadily rising since 1900 at a rate of 1 to 2.5 millimeters per year. In fact, since
1992 new methods of satellite altimetry using the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite indicate a
rate of rise of 3 millimeters per year. The Fourth Assessment Report from the IPCC states
that "there is strong evidence that global sea level gradually rose in the 20th century
and is currently rising at an increased rate, after a period of little change between AD
0 and AD 1900. Sea level is projected to rise at an even greater rate in this century. "
- Fourth Assessment Report on Sea Level Rise Sea level can rise by two different
mechanisms with respect to climate change. The first is the expansion of the sea water as
the oceans warm due to an increasing global temperature. The second mechanism is the
melting of ice over land, which then adds water to the ocean. The IPCC Fourth Assessment
Report predicts that total global-average sea level rise from 1990 - 2100 will be 7 - 15
inches for low emission scenarios and 10 - 23 inches for high emission scenarios]]
