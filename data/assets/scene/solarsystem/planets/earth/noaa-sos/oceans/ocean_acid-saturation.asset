local Name = "Ocean Acidification: Saturation State"
local Identifier = "noaa-sos-oceans-ocean_acid-saturation"
local Description = [[Ocean acidification is an often overlooked consequence of
humankind's release of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere from fossil fuel
burning. Excess carbon dioxide enters the ocean and reacts with water to form carbonic
acid, which decreases ocean pH (i.e., makes seawater less basic), and lowers carbonate
ion concentrations. Organisms such as corals, clams, oysters, and some plankton use
carbonate ions to create their shells and skeletons. Decreases in carbonate ion
concentration will make it difficult for these creatures to form hard structures,
particularly for juveniles. Ocean acidification may cause some organisms to die,
reproduce less successfully, or leave an area. Other organisms such as seagrass and some
plankton species may do better in oceans affected by ocean acidification because they use
carbon dioxide to photosynthesize, but do not require carbonate ions to survive. Ocean
ecosystem diversity and ecosystem services may therefore change dramatically from ocean
acidification]]
