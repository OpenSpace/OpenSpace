    Description = [[This is the site where American astronauts Charles “Pete” Conrad and Alan Bean made the second human landing on the Moon on November 19, 1969. Conrad and Bean landed here aboard the lunar module Intrepid, while Richard Gordon remained in orbit around the Moon in the command module Yankee Clipper. Apollo 12 demonstrated the key capability of a precision landing, with Intrepid touching down less than 200 meters from the site where the Surveyor 3 probe had landed on April 20, 1967. Conrad and Bean conducted 2 EVAs on the lunar surface. The first, lasting 3 hours, 56 minutes, extended to the northwest for deployment of the ALSEP instrument package, and the continued to the rim of a 350-meter diameter crater dubbed Middle Crescent. The second EVA, lasting 3 hours, 49 minutes, was a loop trip of 1.5 km around several craters to the south, including retrieval of a camera from Surveyor 3. They collected 34.35 kilograms of lunar sample material for return to the Earth.
 
In this LRO NAC view of the landing site, the descent stage of the Intrepid is the largest man-made object visible. The dark tracks of the astronauts’ footprints extend out from it. To the northwest, the tracks extend about 130 meters to were components of the ALSEP can be seen. About 160 meters to the southeast of Intrepid, Surveyor 3 is visible with a dense cluster of footprints around it.
 
The landing site, located at 3.0138 S N, 23.4219 W, is in the southern part of Oceanus Procellarum, an area characterized by extensive deposits of basalt significantly younger than that at the Apollo 11 site. The site also provided the first samples of KREEP, material rich in potassium, phosphorus, and rare earth elements. The potential for sampling ejecta from one of the rays extending from the crater Copernicus added to the attractiveness of the site.
