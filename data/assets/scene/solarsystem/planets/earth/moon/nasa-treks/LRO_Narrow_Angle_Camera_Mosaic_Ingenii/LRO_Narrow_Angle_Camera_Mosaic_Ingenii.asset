  Description = [[Mare Ingenii is notable for being one of the few examples of a mare on the far side of the Moon, and the site for notable lunar swirls, enigmatic bright albedo features. This was enough to qualify the area as a Constellation Region of Interest. However, the area became even more interesting with the discovery of a lunar pit in imagery obtained using the Kaguya Terrain Camera. It measures about 130 m in diameter, and researchers speculate that the pit could be a skylight resulting from the collapse of the roof of a lava tube. Whether this is actually the case, and if so, the accessibility and extent of the lava tube have yet to be determined. However, such lava tubes are of great interest as potential locations for lunar bases, offering protection from extreme swings in temperature, galactic and solar radiation, and meteoroid impacts. This data layer was obtained using the Narrow Angle Camera aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and is a is a mosaic of 2 NAC strips centered on the Mare Ingenii pit.]]
