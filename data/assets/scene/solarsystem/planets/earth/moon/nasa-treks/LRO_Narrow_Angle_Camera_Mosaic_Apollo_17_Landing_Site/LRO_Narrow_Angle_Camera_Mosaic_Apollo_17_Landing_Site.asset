    Description = [[This is the site where American astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt made the sixth and final human landing on the Moon of the Apollo program on December 11, 1972. Cernan and Schmitt landed here aboard the lunar module Challenger, while Ronald Evans remained in orbit around the Moon in the command module America. With a PhD in geology, Schmitt was the first and only professional scientist to have visited the Moon. Cernan and Schmitt conducted 3 surface EVAs. The first, lasting 7 hours, 11 minutes, 53 seconds, included deploying the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) approximately 185 meters west-northwest of the lunar module, and conducting a 3.5-kilometer geologic traverse using the lunar rover to the rim of Steno, a small impact crater south of the landing site. The second surface EVA, lasting 7 hours, 36 minutes, 56 seconds, featured a 20.4-kilometer geologic traverse south and west. Stops included a location at the base of South Massif where a landslide had brought ancient highland rocks from high on the mountain into reach, and at Shorty Crater, which was found to be impact rather than volcanic in origin, but which excavated an older volcanic deposit which yielded the famous “orange soil”, beads of volcanic glass erupted in a lunar fire fountain. The third surface EVA, lasting 7 hours, 15 minutes, 8 seconds, had the astronauts making a 20.4-kilometer geologic traverse north and east to North Massif. Stops on this traverse included taking samples of early lunar crust material from large boulders near the base of the massif that had rolled down from high up on the mountain. Cernan and Schmitt collected 110.52 kilograms of lunar sample material for return to the Earth.  

In this LRO NAC view of the landing site, the descent stage of the Challenger is the largest man-made object visible. The dark markings of the astronauts’ footprints and rover tire tracks are visible around the landing site, especially extending to the west-northwest, where components of the ALSEP are visible.

The landing site, located at 20.1911 N, 30.7723 E, is in a narrow valley in the Taurus Mountains near the crater Littrow. The Taurus Mountains form part of the Serenitatis impact basin, and sampling some of the ancient highland terrain into which the basin was excavated could help determine the date of the basin’s formation. Mare basalt subsequently flooded the floor of the valley, and after that parts of the area were blanketed by pyroclastic ash deposits erupting from dark-haloed volcanic craters. The site could therefore provide access to a diverse range of sample material.]]
