    Description = [[The discovery of three lunar pits using imagery from imagery obtained using the Kaguya Terrain Camera led researchers to wonder how common such features might be. A very successful campaign was mounted to search Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) images to see if the higher resolution of NAC might reveal more lunar pits smaller than were detectable with the Kaguya Terrain Camera (R. V. Wagner and M. S. Robinson, 2015, UPDATE: THE SEARCH FOR LUNAR PITS, 2nd International Planetary Caves Conference). Researchers speculate that these lunar pits could be skylights resulting from roof collapse in lava tubes. Whether this is actually the case, and if so, the accessibility and extent of the lava tubes have yet to be determined. However, such lava tubes are of great interest as potential locations for lunar bases, offering protection from extreme swings in temperature, galactic and solar radiation, and meteoroid impacts. This data layer was obtained using the Narrow Angle Camera aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and is a is a mosaic of 2 NAC strips centered on a small pit in Mare Tranquillitatis.]]
