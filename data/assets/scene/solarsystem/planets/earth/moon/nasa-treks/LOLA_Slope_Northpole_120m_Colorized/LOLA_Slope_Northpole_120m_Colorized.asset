The LOLA Laser 1 and 2 data through mission phase LRO_SM_17 are the source for this data set. The bi-directional slope was calculated from a plane fit to three successive laser shots requiring n=5 to 15 profile returns. Depending on orbital velocity, probability of detection, and spacecraft altitude, the slope baseline may vary from 30 to 120 meters.]]
