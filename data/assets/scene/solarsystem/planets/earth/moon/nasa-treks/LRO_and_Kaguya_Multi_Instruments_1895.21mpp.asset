This data layer has been generated by querying specific criteria from the following datasets: Titanium Oxide (TiO2) abundance from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter&rsquo;s (LRO) Wide-Angle Camera (WAC), Optical Maturity Index (OMAT) from Kaguya Lunar Multiband Imager (MI), slope from LRO&rsquo;s Lunar Orbital Laser Altimeter (LOLA), and Rock Abundance from LRO&rsquo;s Lunar Radiometer Experiment (DIVINER). For this &ldquo;Dig Here&rdquo; layer, the following criteria has been applied: TiO2 &gt; 9.0&percnt;, OMAT &lt; 0.15, Slope &lt; 4&deg;, and rock abundance &lt; 0.02&percnt;. The research on Helium-3 as a potential use for fuel for a fusion cell and the data presented as a result of this research culminated as an outcome of a group project at the Colorado School of Mines. The research for this data should be credited to: Stewart Ray, Colleen Olson, Lisa Robibero, Steven Coutts, and Maxwell Sissman of the Planetary and Terrestrial Mining Sciences Symposium and Space Resources Roundtable, Colorado School of Mines.]]
