The images were orthorectified using LRO's Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) polar 5 meter/pixel DEM. The mosaic is generated at half the resolution at which the individual LROC NAC images were gathered, which is approximately 0.5 meters/pixel. The mosaic was registered horizontally to the LOLA global DEM.]]
