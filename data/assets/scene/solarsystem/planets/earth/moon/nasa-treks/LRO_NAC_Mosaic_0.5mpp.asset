  Description = [[This is an orthorectified NAC mosaic of the Von Karman Crater region for the south pole of the Moon. This mosaic includes a total of 370 orthorectified NAC images: 252 sampled at 0.5 m/px and 118 sampled at 1 m/px. NAC orthoimages have been constructed from EDRs downloaded from the Planetary Data System (PDS) and subsequent USGS-ISIS processing. This mosaic has been coaligned to Chang'e-2 20 m/px DEM which has been coaligned to the USGS 59 m/px LOLA-SELENE DEM using ENVI (v5.6.2) patented auto-coreg. Most of the area used stereo-photogrammetrically processing of LROC-NAC stereo-pairs with the UCL CASPGO 3D mapping system, CASP-GO is described in Tao, Y., Muller, J.-P. et al. (2018) Massive Stereo-based DTM Production for Mars on Cloud Computers. Planetary Space Science 154, 30-58 (2018). doi: 10.1016/j.pss.2018.02.012 and CASP-GO is now integrated into ASP (https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/experimental.html?highlight=casp-go#the-casp-go-stereo-processing-system) as part of the NASA PDART program. Individual NAC orthoimages mosaicked together using ArcGIS Pro (v2.9.2). A color balancing algorithm has been applied to roughly correct for color differences at the seams of NAC images. This data has been made available by and should be credited to: Yu Tao and Jan-Peter Muller, Imaging Group, Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London.]]
