    Description = [[The Marius Hills represents one of the most prominent collection of volcanic domes on the Moon. The area was a candidate landing site for the Apollo program and was also designated as a Constellation Region of Interest. It remains a site under consideration for possible future missions. In addition to volcanic domes, the area features basaltic flows, sinuous rilles, and one prominent lunar pit. The Marius Hills pit measures 58 x 49 m in diameter and 40 m deep. It was first noticed in an image taken with the Kaguya Terrain Camera on May 20, 2008, by a team led by Junichi Haruyama . The fact that the Marius Hills pit is located on the floor of a sinuous rille has encouraged speculation the pit could be a skylight resulting from the collapse of the roof of a lava tube. Whether this is actually the case, and if so, the accessibility and extent of the lava tube have yet to be determined. However, such lava tubes are of great interest as potential locations for lunar bases, offering protection from extreme swings in temperature, galactic and solar radiation, and meteoroid impacts. This data layer was obtained using the Narrow Angle Camera aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and is a is a mosaic of 2 NAC strips centered on the Marius Hills pit.]]
