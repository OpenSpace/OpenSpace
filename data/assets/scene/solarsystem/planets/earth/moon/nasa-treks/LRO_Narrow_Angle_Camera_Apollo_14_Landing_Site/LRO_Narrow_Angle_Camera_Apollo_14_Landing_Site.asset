  Description = [[This is the site where American astronauts Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell made the third human landing on the Moon on February 5, 1971. Shepard and Mitchell landed here aboard the lunar module Antares, while Stuart Roosa remained in orbit around the Moon in the command module Kitty Hawk. Shephard and Mitchell conducted 2 EVAs on the lunar surface. The first, lasting 4 hours, 47 minutes, 50 seconds, extended to the west for deployment of the ALSEP instrument package, included collection of a contingency sample, and covered a total distance of about 550 meters. The second EVA, lasting 4 hours, 34 minutes, 41 seconds, was intended to visit Cone Crater, 370 meters in diameter and located approximately 1.2 kilometers to the northeast. To help transport the load of equipment and retrieved samples on this EVA, the astronauts were equipped with a hand-pulled cart, the Modular Equipment Transporter (MET). The rough, hummocky terrain made navigation difficult during the second EVA, and the astronauts were not able to identify the rim of Cone Crater, though later imagery showed that they reached a point about 20 meters south of the crater rim. Shepard and Mitchell collected 42.80 kilograms of lunar sample material for return to the Earth.
 
In this LRO NAC view of the landing site, the descent stage of the Antares is the largest man-made object visible. The dark tracks of the astronauts’ footprints from the first EVA extend to the west, where components of the ALSEP are visible. Extending to the northeast of Antares’ landing site, the track of the astronauts’ footprints and the tracks of the MET’s wheels can be traced toward Cone Crater.
 
The landing site, located at 3.64589 S, 17.47194 W, was selected largely with the goal of sampling material from the Imbrium Basin impact, whose ejecta covers much of this area, known as the Fra Mauro formation.]]
