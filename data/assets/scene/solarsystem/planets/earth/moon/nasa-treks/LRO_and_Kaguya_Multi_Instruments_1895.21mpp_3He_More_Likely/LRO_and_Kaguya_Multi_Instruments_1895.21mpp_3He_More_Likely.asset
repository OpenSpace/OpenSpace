  Description = [[This data represents potential Helium-3 deposits and other solar wind implanted volatiles on the Moon. This data layer has been generated by querying specific criteria from the following datasets: Titanium Oxide (TiO2) abundance from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter&rsquo;s (LRO) Wide-Angle Camera (WAC), Optical Maturity Index (OMAT) from Kaguya Lunar Multiband Imager (MI), slope from LRO&rsquo;s Lunar Orbital Laser Altimeter (LOLA), and Rock Abundance from LRO&rsquo;s Lunar Radiometer Experiment (DIVINER). For this &ldquo;More Likely&rdquo; layer, the following criteria has been applied: TiO2 &gt; 4.5&percnt;, OMAT &lt; 0.225, Slope &lt; 16&deg;, and rock abundance &lt; 0.08&percnt;. The research on Helium-3 as a potential use for fuel for a fusion cell and the data presented as a result of this research culminated as an outcome of a group project at the Colorado School of Mines. The research for this data should be credited to: Stewart Ray, Colleen Olson, Lisa Robibero, Steven Coutts, and Maxwell Sissman of the Planetary and Terrestrial Mining Sciences Symposium and Space Resources Roundtable, Colorado School of Mines.]]
