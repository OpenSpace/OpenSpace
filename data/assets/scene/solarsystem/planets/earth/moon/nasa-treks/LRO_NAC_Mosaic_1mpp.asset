  Description = [[This is an orthorectified NAC mosaic of the Von Karman Crater region for the south pole of the Moon. This mosaic includes 118 individual orthorectified NAC images sampled at 1 m/px. NAC orthoimages have been constructed from EDRs downloaded from the Planetary Data System (PDS) and subsequent USGS-ISIS processing. This mosaic has been coaligned to Chang&rsquo;e 2 20 m/px DEM which has been coaligned to the USGS 59 m/px LOLA-SELENE DEM using ENVI (v5.6.2) patented auto-coreg. Individual NAC orthoimages have been mosaicked together using ArcGIS Pro (v2.9.0). A color balancing algorithm has been applied to roughly correct for color differences at the seams of NAC images. This data has been made available by and should be credited to: Yu Tao and Jan-Peter Muller, Imaging Group, Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London.]]
