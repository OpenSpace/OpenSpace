Each NAC image was processed in ISIS3 at a resolution of 50cm pixel, color balanced, and synthesized into a single output. Apollo 12 was second crewed mission to land on the surface of the Moon. The mission launched on November 14th 1969, and landed five days later at the Ocean of Storms within walking distance of the Surveyor 3 spacecraft.]]
