   Camera (WAC) aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has
   allowed the instrument team to create a global mosaic comprised of
   over 15,000 images acquired between November 2009 and February 2011.
   The WAC maps the whole Moon in one month, however the solar incidence
   angle at the equator changes about 28Â° from the beginning to the end
   of the month. To even out the incidence angle variations (generally
   angles between 55-75 degrees), this morphology mosaic (at 643 nm),
   is comprised of data collected over three periods (1/20/2010 to
   1/28/2010, 5/30/2010 to 6/6/2010, 7/24/2010 to 7/31/2010).
