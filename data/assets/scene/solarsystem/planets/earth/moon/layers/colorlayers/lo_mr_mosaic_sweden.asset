  Description = [[
    This Lunar Orbiter (LO) mosaic of the Moon was constructed using photographs acquired
    by LO III, IV and V. Work towards constructing the global mosaic spanned over seven
    years. Earlier work involved scanning and processing more than 30000 35-mm film strips
    from the LO high- and medium-resolution cameras (HR and MR, respectively).

    Digital film strips were cartographically processed to construct more than 200
    individual frames and then geodetically corrected using the most recent lunar control
    network and topographic model (Gaddis et al., 2001). The result of this work is a
    moderate resolution, near-global, cartographically controlled digital mosaic of the
    Moon (Becker et al., 2008). The nominal resolution of the mosaic is ~60 meters per
    pixel (m).

    This represents new Jpeg2000 mosaic which includes a couple updated tiles that were
    missing from the original March 2008 release. For this image a lossy compression using
    a quality flag of 10 was used. There should be almost no noticeable loss of data. ]]
