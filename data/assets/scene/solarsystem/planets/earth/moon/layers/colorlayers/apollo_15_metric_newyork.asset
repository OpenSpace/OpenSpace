  Description = [[The Apollo 15 Metric (Mapping) Camera obtained high-quality metric photographs,
   on black and white film, with high geometric precision of the lunar surface from lunar orbit
  combined with time-correlated stellar photography for selenodetic/cartographic control. 
  A laser altimeter was operated with it. The Metric Camera also provided supporting 
  photographic data for the Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) Panoramic Camera and 
  other Command Service Module (CSM) photographic experiments. The Apollo 15 metric camera 
  took 3375 frames, some of which were taken over unlighted terrain in support 
  of the laser altimeter. (Description from NASA PDS)]]
