  Description = [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Wide Angle Camera (WAC)
    aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has allowed the instrument team to
    create a global mosaic comprised of over 15,000 images acquired between November 2009
    and February 2011. The WAC maps the whole Moon in one month, however the solar
    incidence angle at the equator changes about 28° from the beginning to the end of the
    month. To even out the incidence angle variations (generally angles between 55-75
    degrees), this morphology mosaic (at 643 nm), is comprised of data collected over
    three periods (1/20/2010 to 1/28/2010, 5/30/2010 to 6/6/2010, 7/24/2010 to 7/31/2010).

    The South Pole mosaic images were acquired 8/10/10 to 9/19/10 and the north polar
    images 4/22/10 to 5/19/10. Some gores were filled with data taken at other times. The
    non-polar images were map projected onto the GLD100, WAC-derived 100 meters per pixel
    (m), while polar images were map projected on the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA)
    shape model (80° to 90° N/S) and the GLD100 (60° to 80° N/S). In addition, the LOLA
    derived crossover corrected ephemeris and an improved camera pointing provide accurate
    positioning of each WAC image. Because the polar images were acquired at a different
    season than the equatorial images, and the lunar photometric function is not perfectly
    known, there can be a brightness difference where the polar mosaics meet the
    equatorial mosaics. This has been greatly reduced in version 3 (created in June 2013).
