  Description = [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Wide Angle Camera (WAC)
    aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has allowed the instrument team to
    create a global mosaic comprised of over 15,000 images acquired between November 2009
    and February 2011. The WAC maps the whole Moon in one month, however the solar
    incidence angle at the equator changes about 28° from the beginning to the end of the
    month. To even out the incidence angle variations (generally angles between 55-75
    degrees), this morphology mosaic (at 643 nm), is comprised of data collected over
    three periods (1/20/2010 to 1/28/2010, 5/30/2010 to 6/6/2010, 7/24/2010 to 7/31/2010).
