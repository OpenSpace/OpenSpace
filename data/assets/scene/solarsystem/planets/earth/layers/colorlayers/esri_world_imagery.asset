    Description = [[World Imagery provides one meter or better satellite and aerial
        imagery in many parts of the world and lower resolution satellite imagery
        worldwide. The map includes 15m TerraColor imagery at small and mid-scales
        (~1:591M down to ~1:72k) and 2.5m SPOT Imagery (~1:288k to ~1:72k) for the world.
        The map features 0.5m resolution imagery in the continental United States and
        parts of Western Europe from Maxar. Additional Maxar sub-meter imagery is
        featured in many parts of the world. In other parts of the world, imagery at
        different resolutions has been contributed by the GIS User Community. In select
        communities, very high resolution imagery (down to 0.03m) is available down to
        ~1:280 scale. (Description from URL)]],
