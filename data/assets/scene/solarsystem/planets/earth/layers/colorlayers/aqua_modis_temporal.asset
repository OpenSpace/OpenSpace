    Description = [[ Temporal coverage: 03 July 2002 - Present. True Color: Red = Band 1,
    Green = Band 4, Blue = Band 3. These images are called true-color or natural color
    because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see.
    The images are natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric
    features. The downside of this set of bands is that they tend to produce a hazy image.
    The MODIS Corrected Reflectance imagery is available only as near real-time imagery.
    The imagery can be visualized in Worldview and the Global Imagery Browse Services 
    (GIBS). The sensor resolution is 500 m and 250 m (Bands 1 and 2 have a sensor
    resolution of 250 m, Bands 3 - 7 have a sensor resolution of 500m, and Bands 8 - 36
    are 1 km. Band 1 is used to sharpen Band 3, 4, 6, and 7), imagery resolution is 250 m,
     and the temporal resolution is daily. (Description from NASA Worldview)]]
