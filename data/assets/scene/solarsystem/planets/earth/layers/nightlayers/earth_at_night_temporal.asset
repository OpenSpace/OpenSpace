  Description = [[The VIIRS Nighttime Imagery (Day/Night Band, Enhanced Near Constant
    Contrast) layer shows the Earth's surface and atmosphere using a sensor designed
    to capture low-light emission sources, under varying illumination conditions. It
    is displayed as a grey-scale image. Sources of illumination include both natural
    and anthropogenic sources of light emissions. Lunar reflection can be used to
    highlight the location and features of clouds and other terrestrial features such
    as sea ice and snow cover when there is partial to full moon conditions. When
    there is no moonlight, natural and anthropogenic night time light emissions are
    highlighted such as city lights, lightning, auroras, fires, gas flares, and
    fishing fleets. This layer is useful for showing patterns of human activity and
    energy behaviors such as cities and highways, the holiday periods, the tracking
    of shipping and fishing fleets at night and, the burning of waste natural gas
    (gas flares) from on and offshore oil/gas production sites. <br><br>The VIIRS
    Nighttime Imagery (Day/Night Band, Enhanced Near Constant Contrast) layer is
    available from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the joint
    NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite.
    The sensor resolution is 750 m at nadir, imagery resolution is 500 m, and the
    temporal resolution is daily. (Description from NASA Worldview)]]

  Description = [[The Black Marble Nighttime At Sensor Radiance (Day/Night Band) layer is
    created from NASA's Black Marble daily at-sensor top-of-atmosphere nighttime radiance
    product (VNP46A1). It is displayed as a grayscale image. The layer is expressed in
    radiance units (nW/(cm2 sr)) with log10 conversion. It is stretched up to
    38 nW/(cm2 sr) resulting in improvements in capturing city lights in greater spatial
    detail than traditional Nighttime Imagery resampled at 0-255 (e.g., Day/Night Band,
    Enhanced Near Constant Contrast).

    The ultra-sensitivity of the VIIRS Day/Night Band enables scientists to capture the
    Earth's surface and atmosphere in low light conditions, allowing for better monitoring
    of nighttime phenomena. These images are also useful for assessing anthropogenic
    sources of light emissions under varying illumination conditions. For instance, during
    partial to full moon conditions, the layer can identify the location and features of
    clouds and other natural terrestrial features such as sea ice and snow cover, while
    enabling temporal observations in urban regions, regardless of moonlit conditions. As
    such, the layer is particularly useful for detecting city lights, lightning, auroras,
    fires, gas flares, and fishing fleets.
