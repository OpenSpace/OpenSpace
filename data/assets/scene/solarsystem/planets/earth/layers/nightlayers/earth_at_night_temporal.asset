    Description = [[ The VIIRS Nighttime Imagery (Day/Night Band, Enhanced Near Constant
        Contrast) layer shows the Earth's surface and atmosphere using a sensor designed
        to capture low-light emission sources, under varying illumination conditions. It
        is displayed as a grey-scale image. Sources of illumination include both natural
        and anthropogenic sources of light emissions. Lunar reflection can be used to
        highlight the location and features of clouds and other terrestrial features such
        as sea ice and snow cover when there is partial to full moon conditions. When
        there is no moonlight, natural and anthropogenic night time light emissions are
        highlighted such as city lights, lightning, auroras, fires, gas flares, and
        fishing fleets. This layer is useful for showing patterns of human activity and
        energy behaviors such as cities and highways, the holiday periods, the tracking
        of shipping and fishing fleets at night and, the burning of waste natural gas
        (gas flares) from on and offshore oil/gas production sites. <br><br>The VIIRS
        Nighttime Imagery (Day/Night Band, Enhanced Near Constant Contrast) layer is
        available from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the joint
        NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite.
        The sensor resolution is 750 m at nadir, imagery resolution is 500 m, and the
        temporal resolution is daily. (Description from NASA Worldview)]],
