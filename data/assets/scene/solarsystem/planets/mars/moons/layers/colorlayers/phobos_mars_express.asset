  Description = [[Images from the European Space Agency's High Resolution Stereo Camera
    (HRSC) aboard the Mars Express were used to obtain 3-dimensional coordinates of
    surface points of Phobos. As currently the HRSC could not gain global coverage yet,
    the data was complimented by Viking orbiter image data to be able to provide the
    digital elevation model (DEM) globally (Willner et al., 2010).  Resolution of this DEM
    is 100 meters per pixel (m).

    The research leading to the data products has received funding from the European
    Community's Seventh Framework Programme ([FP7/2007-2013]) under grant agreement number
    263466 for the FP7-ESPaCE program.
