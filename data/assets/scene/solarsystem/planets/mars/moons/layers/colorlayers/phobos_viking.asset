  Description = [[This mosaic of Phobos was created by compiling updated versions of
    Viking high-resolution mosaics and selecting the best high-resolution images from
    other spacecraft to construct an entirely new mosaic. The process of compiling this
    mosaic significantly improved areas of poor control. Where images with reverse
    lighting meet, artistic effects are necessary to create satisfactory appearance, but
    this affects the appearance only and not the map geometry. This global mosaic has a
    pixel resolution of five meters per pixel (m).

    This image was further color-enhanced based on data from the Mars Reconnaissance
    Orbiter: https://www.planetary.org/space-images/color-view-of-phobos-from-mars-reconnaissance-orbiter#:~:text=The%20color%20view%20shows%20that
