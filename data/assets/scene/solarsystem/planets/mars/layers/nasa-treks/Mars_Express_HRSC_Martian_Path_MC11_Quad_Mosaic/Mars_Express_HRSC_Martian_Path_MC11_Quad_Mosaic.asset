  Description = [[This layer is a combined greyscale mosaic and 50 meter digital terrain model assembled using data from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) aboard the European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter. It covers the MC-11 quadrangle on Mars. For the purposes of mapping, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) has divided the surface of Mars into 30 quadrangles, labeled MC-1 through MC-30 (MC for Mars Chart). Each of the quadrangles also has a proper name derived from a prominent surface feature within the quadrangle. Much of the story of the Martian takes place within MC-11, also known as Oxia Palus. Fortunately, MC-11 happens to be the first complete quadrangle the European Space Agency produced as an HRSC 50m digital terrain model and image mosaic. HRSC is being used to obtain color and stereo images that will map 100% of Mars' surface at resolution better than 30 m/pixel, and 50% of the surface at better than 15 m/pixel. Each of the nine CCD lines of HRSC, a linescan imager (pushbroom camera), contains 5184 pixels. The channels consist of red, green, blue, near-infrared, three stereo channels (backward, nadir, and forward) and two photometric channels. While this mosaic lacks the color information shown in the color mosaic, it does show finer detail. This mosaic was produced by the Global Topography and Mosaic Generation Task Group of the HRSC-Team by joining nearly 100 contiguous HRSC stereo strips. HRSC data provided by ESA/DLR/FU Berlin and the Mars Express HRSC-Team.]]
