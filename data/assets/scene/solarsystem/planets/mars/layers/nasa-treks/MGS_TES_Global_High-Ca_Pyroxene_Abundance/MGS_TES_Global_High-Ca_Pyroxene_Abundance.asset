  Description = [[The Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) is one of the instruments aboard the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft. TES is designed to measure the thermal infrared energy (heat) emitted from Mars. This technique, called thermal emission spectroscopy, can tell us much about the geology and atmosphere of Mars. A deconvolution method was used to remove atmospheric components and determine surface mineralogy from TES data at 1 pixel per degree (ppd). Minerals were grouped into categories on the basis of compositional and spectral similarity, and global concentration maps were produced. High-Ca pyroxenes are identified in concentrations of 0.10 - 0.20 in equatorial low albedo regions. The highest concentrations are present in Syrtis Major. High-latitude, low-albedo regions are characterized by concentrations of 0 - 0.10. Light regions have 0 - 0.05 high-Ca pyroxene concentrations. Only equatorial low-albedo regions have pyroxene concentrations above the detection limit. Map resolution/scale: 4 ppd/16km. Joshua L. Bandfield, 2002, JGR, VOL. 107, NO. E6, 5042]]
