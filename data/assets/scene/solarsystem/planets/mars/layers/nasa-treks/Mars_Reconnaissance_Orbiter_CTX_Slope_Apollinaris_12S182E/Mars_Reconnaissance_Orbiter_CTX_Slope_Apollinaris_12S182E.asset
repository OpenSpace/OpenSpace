  Description = [[This is a colorized version of the original 2x2 pixel slope in degrees (also called a 1 baseline slope). This was produced as part of an effort to characterize topography within candidate Human Exploration Zones for Mars. The DEM was constructed from a pair of CTX images using the stereo photogrammetry software AMES Stereo Pipeline (ASP). THe DEM has been tied to MOLA and can be considered resarch- and visualization-ready. Because it has not been manually edited using a full 3D editing environment, ASP DEMs cannot currently be considered true engineering-ready for performing landings.
