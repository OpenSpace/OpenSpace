  Description = [[The Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) is one of the instruments aboard the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft. TES is designed to measure the thermal infrared energy (heat) emitted from Mars. This technique, called thermal emission spectroscopy, can tell us much about the geology and atmosphere of Mars. A deconvolution method was used to remove atmospheric components and determine surface mineralogy from TES data at 1 pixel per degree (ppd). Minerals were grouped into categories on the basis of compositional and spectral similarity, and global concentration maps were produced. Plagioclase is present in high concentrations in low-albedo regions. High-latitude, low albedo regions have concentrations of 0.05 - 0.15. Equatorial low-albedo regions display concentrations of 0.10 - 0.20 with the highest concentrations in the Syrtis Major region. High-albedo surfaces have plagioclase concentrations of 0 - 0.05, well below the detectable limit. Where there are significant concentrations, average plagioclase compositions are intermediate to calcic. Map resolution/scale: 4 ppd/16km. Joshua L. Bandfield, 2002, JGR, VOL. 107, NO. E6, 5042]]
