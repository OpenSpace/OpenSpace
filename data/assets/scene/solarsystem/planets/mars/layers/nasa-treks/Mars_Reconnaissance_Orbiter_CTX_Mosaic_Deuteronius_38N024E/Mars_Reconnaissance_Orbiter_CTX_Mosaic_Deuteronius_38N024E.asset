    Description = [[This is a CTX orthorectified image, geometrically corrected using its own source digital elevation model (DEM/DTM), as produced as part of an effort to characterize candidate Human Exploration Zones for Mars. The original DEM was constructed from a pair of CTX images using the stereo photogrammetry software AMES Stereo Pipeline (ASP). The DEM, and thus orthoimage, has been tied to MOLA and can be considered resarch- and visualization-ready. Because it has not been manually edited using a full 3D editing environment, ASP DEMs cannot currently be considered true engineering-ready for performing landings.
