  Description = [[This is a preliminary uncontrolled Context Camera (CTX) mosaic, called beta01, that the Murray Lab at Caltech has created to (1) generate a list of orbits that will be included in the final mosaic, (2) decipher challenges involved with generating a product of this unprecedented scale, and (3) solicit feedback from the Mars science community for how best to generate the mosaic in a way that helps as diverse a group of scientists as possible. The CTX camera, as managed by Malin Space Science Systems (MSSS), has attained near global coverage of Mars at the scale of ~5 m/pixel. All data used in the construction of this CTX global mosaic have been publicly released and are freely available via the NASA Planetary Data System. The Murray Lab/Caltech grants free use of the beta01 version of the mosaic for all purposes. When used, data credit should be: NASA/JPL/MSSS/The Caltech Murray Lab/Esri. This tiled web service, as hosted by Esri, is made available using lossy Jpeg compression at an 8 bit data range.
