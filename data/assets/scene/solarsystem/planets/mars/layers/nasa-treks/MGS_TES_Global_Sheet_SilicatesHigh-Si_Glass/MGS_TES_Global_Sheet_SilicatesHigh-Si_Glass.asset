    Description = [[The Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) is one of the instruments aboard the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft. TES is designed to measure the thermal infrared energy (heat) emitted from Mars. This technique, called thermal emission spectroscopy, can tell us much about the geology and atmosphere of Mars. A deconvolution method was used to remove atmospheric components and determine surface mineralogy from TES data at 1 pixel per degree (ppd). Minerals were grouped into categories on the basis of compositional and spectral similarity, and global concentration maps were produced. The sheet silicate and high-Si glass map is slightly noisier than the other mineralogy maps. This is likely due to the spectral similarity between the sheet silicate and high-Si glass end-member group and the atmospheric dust spectral shapes. The highest concentrations are located in northern hemisphere low-albedo regions with concentrations of 0.05 - 0.20. High concentrations are also present in several isolated regions south of Solis Planum, southeast of Hellas Basin, and along the edge of the southern polar cap. High albedo regions contain 0 - 0.10 sheet silicate and high-Si glass concentrations. Equatorial and southern hemisphere low-albedo regions typically have concentrations of 0.05 - 0.15 with the exception of some isolated areas. Map resolution/scale: 4 ppd/16km. Joshua L. Bandfield, 2002, JGR, VOL. 107, NO. E6, 5042]]
