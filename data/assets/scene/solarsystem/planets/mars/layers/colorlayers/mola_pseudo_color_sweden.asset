    Description = [[This map is based on data from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA)
        (Smith, et al., 2001), an instrument on NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor (MGS)
        spacecraft (Albee, et al., 2001). The image used for the base of this map
        represents more than 600 million measurements gathered between 1999 and 2001,
        adjusted for consistency (Neumann, et al., 2001; Neumann, et al., 2003) and
        converted to planetary radii. These have been converted to elevations above the
        areoid as determined from a Martian gravity field solution GMM-2B (Lemoine, et
        al., 2001), truncated to degree and order 50, and oriented according to current
        standards (see below). The average accuracy of each point is originally ~100
        meters in horizontal position and ~1 meter in radius (Neumann, et al., 2001;
        Neumann, et al., 2003). However, the total elevation uncertainty is at least ±3 m
        due to the global error in the areoid (±1.8 meters; Lemoine, et al., 2001) and
        regional uncertainties in its shape (Neumann, 2002). Pixel resolution of this map
        is 463 meters per pixel (m). (Description from URL). Data Reference: (See URL).]],
