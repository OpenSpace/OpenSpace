    Description = [[This layer is an equatorial uncontrolled composite mosaic of the
        HiRISE imagery, using all available red band images released through 2018. The
        HiRISE instrument, operated by the University of Arizona, is on board NASA's
        2005 Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). While the resolution of the imagery is
        very high, the imagery is somewhat limited in spatial extent, covering only about
        3% of the plant's surface. The images in this layer are spatially located using
        only the initial spacecraft pointing information.  All source images used in the
        construction of this layer were produced by the team at the University of Arizona.
        This tiled web service, as hosted by Esri, is made available using lossy Jpeg
        compression using an 8 bit data range, using a linear stretch from the original
        10 bit range. (Description from URL)]],
