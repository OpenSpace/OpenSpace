    Description = [[This product contains CTX data through MRO release 45, CTX mission
        phase J21 (December 1, 2017). The mosaic is comprised of 74,196 separate CTX
        images out of 95,106 available (78.0%). Orbits not included were either (1) low
        signal/noise (increased atmospheric opacity), or (2) redundant coverage (stereo
        targets, change detection, etc.). With low-quality images removed, the mosaic
        covers 97.3% of Mars. The mosaic covers 88째S to 88째N. All data are resampled to
        5.0 m/px, including 2,334 orbits (3.14%) that are natively higher resolution than
        5.0 m/px, though no images are higher resolution than 4.93 m/px. The planet was
        divided into 3,960 4째x4째 tiles, which are not blended with each other in this
        version. As we describe below, every pixel can be traced to its host orbit through
        vectorized seam-maps that are provided with every tile. These seam-maps provide
        pixel-for-pixel spatial documentation of image seams, to prevent misinterpretation
        of seams as possible landforms and to provide instant access to original data. A
        completely seamless CTX mosaic is currently infeasible, so seam-maps are required
        to prevent misinterpretation. (Description from URL)]],
