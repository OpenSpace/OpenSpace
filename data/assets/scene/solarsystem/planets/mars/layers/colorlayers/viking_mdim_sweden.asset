    Description = [[This global image map of Mars has a resolution of 256 pixels/degree
        (scale approximately 232 meters per pixel (m) at the equator). The colorized
        mosaic was completed by NASA AMES which warped the original Viking colorized
        mosaic and blended over the latest black/white Mars Digital Image Model
        (MDIM 2.1). The positional accuracy of features in MDIM 2.1 is estimated to be
        roughly one pixel (200 m), compared to 3 km for MDIM 2.0 released in 2001 and >6
        km for MDIM 1.0 released in 1991. In addition to relatively imprecise geodetic
        control, the previous mosaics were affected by changing definitions of
        cartographic parameters (such as the definition of zero longitude),
        resulting in an overall longitude shift of as much as 0.2Â° between the early MDIMs
        and other datasets. The new mosaic uses the most recent coordinate system
        definitions for Mars. These definitions have been widely adopted by NASA missions
        and other users of planetary data and are likely to remain in use for a decade or
        more. As a result, MDIM 2.1 not only registers precisely with data from current
        missions such as Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) and 2001 Mars Odyssey but will serve
        as an accurate basemap on which data from future missions can be plotted.
