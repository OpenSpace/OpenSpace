  Description = [[This product contains CTX data through MRO release 45, CTX mission
    phase J21 (December 1, 2017). The mosaic is comprised of 74,196 separate CTX
    images out of 95,106 available (78.0%). Orbits not included were either (1) low
    signal/noise (increased atmospheric opacity), or (2) redundant coverage (stereo
    targets, change detection, etc.). With low-quality images removed, the mosaic
    covers 97.3% of Mars. The mosaic covers 88°S to 88°N. All data are resampled to
    5.0 m/px, including 2,334 orbits (3.14%) that are natively higher resolution than
    5.0 m/px, though no images are higher resolution than 4.93 m/px. The planet was
    divided into 3,960 4°x4° tiles, which are not blended with each other in this
    version. As we describe below, every pixel can be traced to its host orbit through
    vectorized seam-maps that are provided with every tile. These seam-maps provide
    pixel-for-pixel spatial documentation of image seams, to prevent misinterpretation
    of seams as possible landforms and to provide instant access to original data. A
    completely seamless CTX mosaic is currently infeasible, so seam-maps are required
    to prevent misinterpretation. (Description from URL)]]
