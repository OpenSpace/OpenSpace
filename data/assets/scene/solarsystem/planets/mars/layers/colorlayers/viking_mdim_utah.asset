  Description = [[This global image map of Mars has a resolution of 256 pixels/degree
    (scale approximately 232 meters per pixel (m) at the equator). The colorized
    mosaic was completed by NASA AMES which warped the original Viking colorized
    mosaic and blended over the latest black/white Mars Digital Image Model
    (MDIM 2.1). The positional accuracy of features in MDIM 2.1 is estimated to be
    roughly one pixel (200 m), compared to 3 km for MDIM 2.0 released in 2001 and >6
    km for MDIM 1.0 released in 1991. In addition to relatively imprecise geodetic
    control, the previous mosaics were affected by changing definitions of
    cartographic parameters (such as the definition of zero longitude),
    resulting in an overall longitude shift of as much as 0.2° between the early MDIMs
    and other datasets. The new mosaic uses the most recent coordinate system
    definitions for Mars. These definitions have been widely adopted by NASA missions
    and other users of planetary data and are likely to remain in use for a decade or
    more. As a result, MDIM 2.1 not only registers precisely with data from current
    missions such as Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) and 2001 Mars Odyssey but will serve
    as an accurate basemap on which data from future missions can be plotted.
