    Description = [[ HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) is the most
        powerful camera ever sent to another planet, one of six instruments onboard the
        Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. We launched in 2005, arrived at Mars in 2006 and have
        been imaging ever since. Our camera’s high resolution capability (imaging up to 30
        centimeters per pixel) remains unprecedented for any existing orbiter in the study
        of the Red Planet, as well as being an indispensable instrument for helping to
        select landing sites for robotic and future human exploration. In the past decade,
        we’ve also imaged avalanches in progress, and discovered dark flows that may or
        may not be briny seeps. Hundreds of science papers have been published with our
        data. (Description from URL). This map contains a subet set of the HiRISE
        DEM where available as of 2018.]],
