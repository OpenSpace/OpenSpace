    Description = [[ This digital elevation model (DEM) is based on data from the Mars
        Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA; Smith et al., 2001), an instrument on NASA's Mars
        Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft (Albee et al., 2001). The MOLA DEM represents
        more than 600 million measurements gathered between 1999 and 2001, adjusted for
        consistency (Neumann et al., 2001; Neumann, Smith & Zuber, 2003) and converted to
        planetary radii. These have been converted to elevations above the areoid as
        determined from a Martian gravity field solution GMM-2B (Lemoine et al., 2001),
        truncated to degree and order 50, and oriented according to current standards.
        The average accuracy of each point is originally ~100 meters in horizontal
        position and ~1 meter in radius (Neumann et al., 2001). However, the total
        elevation uncertainty is at least ±3 m due to the global error in the areoid
        (±1.8 meters; Neumann et al., 2001) and regional uncertainties in its shape
        (Neumann, 2002). Pixel resolution is 463 meters per pixel (m). (Description from
        URL). Data Reference: (See URL).]],
