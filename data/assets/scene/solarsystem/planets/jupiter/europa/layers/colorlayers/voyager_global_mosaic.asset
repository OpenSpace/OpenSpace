    Description = [[ Europa Voyager - Galileo SSI Global Mosaic 500m v2. This global map
        base of Europa utilizes the best image quality and moderate resolution coverage
        supplied by the Galileo SSI (Solid-State Imaging) instrument and Voyager 1 and 2.
        The image data was selected on the basis of overall image quality, reasonable
        input resolution (from 20 km/pixel for gap fill to as high as 200 meters per
        pixel[m]), and availability of moderate viewing and sun angles for topography.
        The map projections are based on a sphere having a radius of 1,562.09 kilometers.
        A Simple Cylindrical projection was used at a resolution of 500 m. (Description
