  Description = [[This May 2013 basemap is a combination of the following mosaics; (1)
  The 2013-05-10 version of the monochrome global mosaic, made from Applied Coherent
  Technology (ACT) Corporation tiles, (2) An average north polar mosaic from 90N to 82.5N,
  composed of images from many campaigns, made by C. Ernst, and (3) An average south
  polar mosaic from 90S to 85S, composed of images from the south polar monitoring
  campaign from the primary mission, made by N. Chabot. To fill minor areas of missing
  data, the 2013-05-10 version of the high-incidence global mosaic was underlain. This
  monochrome mosaic is composed of Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) Narrow Angle
  Camera (NAC) images and Wide Angle Camers (WAC) images acquired in the filter centered
  at 750 nm. The resolution of this mosaic is 250 meters per pixel (m)]]
