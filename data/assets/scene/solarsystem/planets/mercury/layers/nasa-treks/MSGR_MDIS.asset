This color hillshade was generated in ArcPro with the shaded-relief raster function. The resolution of the original DEM used to create this product is 64 pixels/degree (665 m/pixel). The control network used for registration contains tie points that are sample/line coordinates with geometric locations (derived from SPICE) that are automatically measured across the overlapping image areas. Elevation values are in meters and referred to a radius of 2439400m. The legend conveys the mapping colors to elevation values (meters).]]
