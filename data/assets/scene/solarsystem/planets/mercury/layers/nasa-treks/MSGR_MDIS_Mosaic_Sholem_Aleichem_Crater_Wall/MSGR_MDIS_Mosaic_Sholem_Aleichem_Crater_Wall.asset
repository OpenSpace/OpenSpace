  Description = [[This is a visible orthoimage for the Sholem Aleichem Crater Wall region on Mercury. This data product class of this data is observational and has been constructed to examine the visible and topographic settings of landforms around Mercuryâ€™s hollows. Observations of topography, specifically the relationships of hollows to their surroundings, can be used to investigate hollow formation. The visible image has been orthorectified using a digital elevation model (DEM) created from Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) stereo pair images. The DEM used to generate the orthoimage has been aligned and controlled to Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) individual elevation points. The orthoimage was then projected onto the DEM and exported. This ortho image has been generated at a resolution of 8m/pixel.]]
