    Description = [[This is a slope product of the digital elevation model (DEM) for the Kertesz Crater region on Mercury. This data product class of this data is observational and has been constructed to examine the topographic settings of landforms around Mercury’s hollows. Observations of topography, specifically the relationships of hollows to their surroundings, can be used to investigate hollow formation. This DEM has been derived from Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) data and has been generated at a resolution of 100m/pixel. The DEM has been aligned and controlled to Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) individual elevation points. Vertical offsets in this DEM have been roughly corrected relative to the USGS’s 665m Global DEM of Mercury. DEM elevation values are in meters and referred to a radius of 2440000m. Slope values are in degrees with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 51.033.]]
