The mission will characterize these moons as both planetary objects and possible habitats, explore Jupiter's complex environment in depth, and study the wider Jupiter system as an archetype for gas giants across the Universe.",

Though Juice will make flybys of all three of Jupiter's largest Galilean moons (Ganymede, Europa and Callisto), Ganymede is the only one that the spacecraft will orbit. In doing so, Juice will become the first spacecraft ever to orbit a moon other than our own, enabling us to see the Jovian world in a whole new light. Ganymede is also the only moon in the Solar System to generate its own magnetic field. Juice will explore various key topics: Ganymede's puzzling magnetic field, its hidden ocean, its complex core, its ice content and shell, its interactions with its local environment and that of Jupiter, its past and present activity, and whether or not the moon could be - or ever have been - a habitable environment."
