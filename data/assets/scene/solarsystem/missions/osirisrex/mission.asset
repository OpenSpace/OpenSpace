        Comment :   Precision is not even month - it just defines the overall mission approach

        Comment :   Data taken from text descriptions of the visualizations. There is a little time bar up
                    in the upper right corner.

        Comment :   The spice data is split up into across different files. These files
                    seems to represent different phases. A script was used to extract the 
                    SPICE coverage from all .bc files and use the names of the files as
                    mission names and associate the name with the time coverage.

The mission will help scientists investigate how planets formed and how life began, as well as improve our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth.",

This image was taken just hours after the spacecraft completed its Earth Gravity Assist at a range of approximately 106,000 miles (170,000 kilometers). MapCam is part of the OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite (OCAMS) operated by the University of Arizona. Visible in this image are the Pacific Ocean and several familiar landmasses, including Australia in the lower left, and Baja California and the southwestern United States in the upper right. The dark vertical streaks at the top of the image are caused by short exposure times (less than three milliseconds). Short exposure times are required for imaging an object as bright as Earth, but are not anticipated for an object as dark as the asteroid Bennu, which the camera was designed to image.
