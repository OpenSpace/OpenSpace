Its mission: to probe beneath the planet's dense clouds and answer questions about the origin and evolution of Jupiter, our solar system, and giant planets in general across the cosmos. Juno arrived at Jupiter on July 4, 2016, after a 5-year, 1.7-billion-mile journey, and settled into a 53-day polar orbit stretching from just above Jupiter's cloud tops to the outer reaches of the Jovian magnetosphere.",

      Description = "Juno's discoveries have revolutionized our understanding of Jupiter and solar system formation. During the prime mission's 35 orbits of Jupiter, Juno collected more than three terabits (375 gigabytes) of science data and provided dazzling views of Jupiter and its satellites, all processed by citizen scientists with NASA's first-ever camera dedicated to public outreach. Juno's many discoveries have changed our view of Jupiter's atmosphere and interior, revealing an atmospheric weather layer that extends far beyond its clouds and a deep interior with a diluted, or 'fuzzy,' heavy element core. Near the end of the prime mission, as the spacecraft's orbit evolved, flybys of the moon Ganymede initiated Juno's transition into a full Jovian system explorer.",
