With more than half a billion people watching on television, he climbs down the ladder and proclaims: 'That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind'. Aldrin joins him shortly, and offers a simple but powerful description of the lunar surface: 'magnificent desolation'. They explore the surface for two and a half hours, collecting samples and taking photographs. They leave behind an American flag, a patch honoring the fallen Apollo 1 crew, and a plaque on one of Eagle's legs. It reads, 'Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon. July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.'",
