  Description = [[BepiColombo is Europe's first mission to Mercury. It launched in October 2018 on a journey to the smallest and least explored terrestrial planet in our Solar System. Arriving at Mercury in December 2025, it will endure temperatures in excess of 350Â°C and gather data during a 1 year nominal mission. The mission comprises two spacecraft: 1. Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO), 2. Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO). BepiColombo is a joint mission between ESA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), executed under ESA leadership.]],
