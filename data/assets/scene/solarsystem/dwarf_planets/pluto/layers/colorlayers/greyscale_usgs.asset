  Description = [[This detailed, high-quality global mosaic of Pluto was assembled from
    nearly all of the highest-resolution images obtained by the Long-Range
    Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) and the Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC)
    on New Horizons.The mosaic is the most detailed and comprehensive global view yet
    of Pluto's surface using New Horizons data. It includes topography data of the
    hemisphere visible to New Horizons during the spacecraft's closest approach. The
    topography is derived from digital stereo-image mapping tools that measure the
    parallax - or the difference in the apparent relative positions - of features on
    the surface obtained at different viewing angles during the encounter. Scientists
    use these parallax displacements of high and low terrain to estimate landform
    heights.The mosaic is available in Equirectangular projection at an equatorial
    pixel scale of 300 meters per pixel (m). (Description from URL)]],
