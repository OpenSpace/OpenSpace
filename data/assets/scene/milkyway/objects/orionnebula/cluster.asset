    Description = [[ In order to have an accurate depiction of the
Orion nebula, we need to include the star cluster that was birthed
from it. We turned to a study of the cluster’s stellar population by
Lynne Hillenbrand, who was working at the University of California, Berkeley at 
the time.The catalog from her paper contains more than 1,500 stars, about
half the stars in the actual cluster. The cluster is very crowded, with
a peak density of 10,000 stars per cubic parsec over a wide range
of masses from a tenth the sun’s mass up to 50 times its mass. We
were presented with one problem: there are no distances.
For the stellar distances, we needed to deduce them by statistical
methods. Knowing the size of the cluster and approximating the
shape to be roughly spherical, we placed each star along a line
of sight through this imaginary sphere centered on the cluster. In
this sense, these data are observed data and the view from Earth is
accurate. But the distance of each star has been derived from this
educated-guess approach for the cluster distribution. ]],
