    Description = [[ In order to have an accurate depiction of the Orion nebula, we need 
to include the star cluster that was birthed from it. We turned to a study of the 
cluster's stellar population by Lynne Hillenbrand, who was working at the University of 
California, Berkeley at the time. The catalog from her paper contains more than 1500 
stars, about half the stars in the actual cluster. The cluster is very crowded, with a 
peak density of 10000 stars per cubic parsec over a wide range of masses from a tenth the 
sun's mass up to 50 times its mass. We were presented with one problem: there are no 
distances. For the stellar distances, we needed to deduce them by statistical methods. 
Knowing the size of the cluster and approximating the shape to be roughly spherical, we 
placed each star along a line of sight through this imaginary sphere centered on the 
cluster. In this sense, these data are observed data and the view from Earth is accurate. 
But the distance of each star has been derived from this educated-guess approach for the 
cluster distribution. ]],
