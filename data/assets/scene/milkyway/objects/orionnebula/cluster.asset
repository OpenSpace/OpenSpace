    Description = [[In order to have an accurate depiction of the Orion nebula, we need to
      include the star cluster that was birthed from it. We turned to a study of the
      cluster's stellar population by Lynne Hillenbrand, who was working at the University
      of California, Berkeley at the time. The catalog from her paper contains more than
      1500 stars, about half the stars in the actual cluster. The cluster is very crowded,
      with a peak density of 10000 stars per cubic parsec over a wide range of masses from
      a tenth the sun's mass up to 50 times its mass. We were presented with one problem:
      there are no distances. For the stellar distances, we needed to deduce them by
      statistical methods. Knowing the size of the cluster and approximating the shape to
      be roughly spherical, we placed each star along a line of sight through this
      imaginary sphere centered on the cluster. In this sense, these data are observed
      data and the view from Earth is accurate. But the distance of each star has been
      derived from this educated-guess approach for the cluster distribution]]
