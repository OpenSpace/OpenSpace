    Description = [[For decades it was believed that M stars were the coolest stars in
      the Galaxy. Some M stars, called red dwarfs, make up 70% of the stars in the
      Galaxy. However, a new class of objects, even cooler than M stars, was recently
      discovered and given a spectral type of L. L-type objects straddle the boundary
      between red dwarfs and brown dwarfs and they are typically very dim stars or brown
      dwarfs. Even cooler than L-type objects are T-type objects. These are mostly brown
      dwarfs and resemble large, massive, Jupiter-like objects, too large to be planets
      and typically too small to be stars. Beyond the T dwarfs are the Y-type objects,
      which are even more dim. Brown dwarfs are extremely difficult to see, mainly because
      they are so dim in optical light. However, they appear brighter in infrared light.
      Colors: We represent these objects as exaggeratged points and they are either red
      for L type objects, Maroon for T type, and purple for Y type objects. Census:
      2,196 objects.]]
