            are young groups of stars that were formed within a giant molecular cloud, but
            have dispersed after the original gas and dust from the cloud was blown away
            by the star's radiation pressure. Although an association's stars are no
            longer gravitationally bound to one another, they share a common motion in
            space because they were formed from the same cloud. This allows astronomers to
            easily determine OB association membership stars. These objects are color
            coded by their spiral arm membership. Blue associations trace the Sagittarius
            Arm. Purple associations are in the local Orion Spur. Orange associations are
            in the Perseus Arm (Description from URL) <br><br> Data Reference: New List of
            OB Associations (Melnik+)]],
