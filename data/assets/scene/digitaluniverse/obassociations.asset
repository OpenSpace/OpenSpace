    Description = [[Census: 61 OB associations. DU Version 2.4. <br> OB associations
      are young groups of stars that were formed within a giant molecular cloud, but
      have dispersed after the original gas and dust from the cloud was blown away
      by the star's radiation pressure. Although an association's stars are no
      longer gravitationally bound to one another, they share a common motion in
      space because they were formed from the same cloud. This allows astronomers to
      easily determine OB association membership stars. These objects are color
      coded by their spiral arm membership. Blue associations trace the Sagittarius
      Arm. Purple associations are in the local Orion Spur. Orange associations are
      in the Perseus Arm (Description from URL) <br><br> Data Reference: New List of
      OB Associations (Melnik+)]]
