      arms. We label them in this manner--"hard-coding" the labels into an image rather
      than having native labels--so that they can retain their size, shape, and location
      as they overlay the galaxy. These labels are designed to be a guide, and they map
      more accurately to the various datasets in the Digital Universe. For example, the
      pulsars, the star-forming (HII) regions, and open clusters all show the local spiral
      structure. We can use trends in these data sets to map the arms of the Milky Way.
