        Description = [[Census: 2,600,258 galaxies. DU Version 10.6.<br> The Sloan Digital
            Sky Survey (SDSS) is an ambitious project to image about 35% of the sky, deep
            into the universe. The survey measured the position and brightness of almost 1
            billion objects, and obtained spectra to more than 4 million objects. This is
            not an all-sky survey, so there are large parts of the sky that remain
            unobserved, which produces the bow tie distribution and the black areas where
            there surely are galaxies, but we have yet to observe them. These galaxies
            appear to extend beyond the 2dF survey to distances that exceed 5 billion
            light years. However, the weblike structure of clusters, filaments, and voids
            seems to fade by about 2 billion light years. Beyond this distance, the
            completeness of the survey drops so that only the intrinsically bright
            galaxies are visible. The weblike cosmic structure is echoed in these data,
            with orange clusters standing out among the less dense aqua-colored galaxies
            and the less dense regions of green-colored galaxies. (Description from URL)
