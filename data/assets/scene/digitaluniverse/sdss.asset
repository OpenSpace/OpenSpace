    Description = [[Census: 2,600,258 galaxies. DU Version 10.6.<br> The Sloan Digital
      Sky Survey (SDSS) is an ambitious project to image about 35% of the sky, deep
      into the universe. The survey measured the position and brightness of almost 1
      billion objects, and obtained spectra to more than 4 million objects. This is
      not an all-sky survey, so there are large parts of the sky that remain
      unobserved, which produces the bow tie distribution and the black areas where
      there surely are galaxies, but we have yet to observe them. These galaxies
      appear to extend beyond the 2dF survey to distances that exceed 5 billion
      light years. However, the weblike structure of clusters, filaments, and voids
      seems to fade by about 2 billion light years. Beyond this distance, the
      completeness of the survey drops so that only the intrinsically bright
      galaxies are visible. The weblike cosmic structure is echoed in these data,
      with orange clusters standing out among the less dense aqua-colored galaxies
      and the less dense regions of green-colored galaxies. (Description from URL)
