            Milky Way is simply a two-dimensional image. The image is that of NGC 1232, a
            galaxy thought to resemble our Milky Way. The image has been properly sized
            and approximately oriented to function as a placeholder, allowing one to see
            the context of the Galaxy relative to other data in the atlas. The features
            you see in the image, of course, do not represent our Galaxy, per se, but
            resemble similar features found in our Galaxy.(Description from URL)
