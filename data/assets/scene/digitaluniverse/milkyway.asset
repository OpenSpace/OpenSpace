      two-dimensional image. The image is that of NGC 1232, a galaxy thought to resemble
      our Milky Way. The image has been properly sized and approximately oriented to
      function as a placeholder, allowing one to see the context of the Galaxy relative
      to other data in the atlas. The features you see in the image, of course, do not
      represent our Galaxy, per se, but resemble similar features found in our Galaxy.
