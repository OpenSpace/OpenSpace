        Milky Way is simply a two-dimensional image. The image is that of NGC 1232, a
        galaxy thought to resemble our Milky Way. The image has been properly sized
        and approximately oriented to function as a placeholder, allowing one to see
        the context of the Galaxy relative to other data in the atlas. The features
        you see in the image, of course, do not represent our Galaxy, per se, but
        resemble similar features found in our Galaxy.(Description from URL)
