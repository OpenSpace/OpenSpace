    Description = [[Cosmic voids are vast, empty spaces where there are either no
      galaxies, or very few galaxies. They are associated with cold spots in the cosmic
      microwave background (CMB) light, the earliest picture we have of the universe.
      Those cold spots in the CMB evolved into large voids, some as much as 300 million
      light years in diameter. Labels roughly denote the location of cosmic voids in the
      Tully galaxies. Voids are only visible with motion cuing as you spin around these
      data. The labels help to guide the eye and provide sign posts for the largest voids
      in our cosmic neighborhood. Census: 24 cosmic void labels.]]
