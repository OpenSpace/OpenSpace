            vast, empty spaces where there are either no galaxies, or very few galaxies.
            They are associated with cold spots in the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
            light, the earliest picture we have of the universe (see page 58). Those cold
            spots in the CMB evolved into large voids, some as much as 300 million light
            years in diameter. Labels roughly denote the location of cosmic voids in the
            Tully galaxies. Voids are only visible with motion cuing as you spin around
            these data. The labels help to guide the eye and provide sign posts for the
            largest voids in our cosmic neighborhood. (Description from URL) <br><br> Data
