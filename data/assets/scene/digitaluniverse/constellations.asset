            modern constellations are largely based on those of the Babylonians and
            Greeks; however, most cultures have their own figures and stories of the sky.
            More than half the official constellations adopted by scientists in 1930 were
            known to the ancients over 2,000 years ago. Each star falls into one of these
            88 regions. Of course, today we know the stars in any given constellation do
            not necessarily have any physical relationship with one another. One star may
            be nearby, while an adjacent star in the sky may be far away.(Description
            from URL) <br><br> Data Reference: various]],
