            leave behind one of three possible remnants: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or
            a black hole. Stars that are more massive than the sun will often become
            neutron stars in a violent explosion called a supernova. During a supernova,
            the core of the star collapses under such high pressure that the electrons,
            which normally remain outside the atomic nucleus, are forced to combine with
            the protons in the nucleus. Atomic nuclei break apart, producing what is
            called a degenerate state of matter. The collapse is halted when the material
            cannot be packed any tighter. At this point, the star has a radius of about
            10-15 kilometers. The density of this material is so high that a teaspoonful
            would weigh about 100 million tons on Earth. (Description from URL) <br><br>
