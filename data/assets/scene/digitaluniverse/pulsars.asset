    Description = [[A pulsar is a spinning neutron star, an ultra-dense stellar remnant
      resulting from a supernova-driven collapse of the stellar core. Upon death, stars
      leave behind one of three possible remnants: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a
      black hole. Stars that are more massive than the sun will often become neutron
      stars in a violent explosion called a supernova. Pulsars are not pulsing but are
      spinning neutron stars whose beams of radiation point toward Earth just as a
      lighthouse sweeps the horizon. Their strong magnetic fields funnel beams of light
      from its poles. When these beams point to Earth, we see a strong radio signal.
      Census: 3,221 pulsars.]]
