    Description = [[A supernova remnant is the nebulous gas left over from a supernova
      explosion. This gas expands at great speeds and rams into the surrounding
      interstellar gas. This excites the surrounding gas and causes it to glow, producing
      the nebulous cloud we observe from Earth. A supernova remnant contains a neutron
      star or pulsar at its center, the core of the dying star. The cloud that enshrouds
      the core does not last long, though. After about 50,000 years, the gas mixes into
      the interstellar medium and no longer glows. Astronomically, this is a very short
      time, so the supernova remnants we see must be left from explosions that have
      occurred recently, cosmically speaking. Census: 112 supernova remnants.]]
