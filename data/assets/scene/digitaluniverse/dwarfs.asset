            <br> In astronomy, there are dwarf stars-red, white, and brown-dwarf novae,
            and even dwarf galaxies. As you might imagine, astronomers use the term dwarf
            when they refer to the smaller objects in any given class. For decades it was
            believed that M stars were the coolest stars in the Galaxy. Some M stars,
            called red dwarfs, make up 70% of the stars in the Galaxy, including our
            nearest known neighbor, Proxima Centauri. However, a new class of objects,
            even cooler than M stars, was recently discovered and given a spectral type
            of L. L-type objects straddle the boundary between red dwarfs and brown
            dwarfs, the latter of which are not massive enough to ignite the nuclear
            processes necessary for it to shine as a star. L-type objects are typically
            very dim stars or brown dwarfs. Even cooler than L-type objects are T-type
            objects. These are mostly brown dwarfs and resemble large, massive,
            Jupiter-like objects, too large to be planets and typically too small to be
            stars. Beyond the T dwarfs are the Y-type objects, which are even more
            dim.(Description from URL) <br><br> Data Reference: The Brown Dwarf Kinematics
