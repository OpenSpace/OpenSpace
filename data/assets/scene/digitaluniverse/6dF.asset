            (6dF) Galaxy Survey mapped nearly half the sky from the Anglo-Australian
            Observatory. Unlike previous datasets, this one is not all-sky, meaning there
            are patches of sky that are not covered. In this case, the entire northern
            hemisphere has no coverage at all. This catalog overlaps with the Tully
            dataset, and there is a noticeable difference in the quality of these
            datasets. Tully is much tighter and the structure is more apparent, while the
            6dF data are more spread out. This is because of local motions within galaxy
            clusters have not been corrected in these data. (Description from URL)
