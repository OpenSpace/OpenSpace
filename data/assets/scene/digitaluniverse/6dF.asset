    Description = [[Census 109,569 galaxies. DU Version 1.4.<br> The Six-degree Field
        (6dF) Galaxy Survey mapped nearly half the sky from the Anglo-Australian
        Observatory. Unlike previous datasets, this one is not all-sky, meaning there
        are patches of sky that are not covered. In this case, the entire northern
        hemisphere has no coverage at all. This catalog overlaps with the Tully
        dataset, and there is a noticeable difference in the quality of these
        datasets. Tully is much tighter and the structure is more apparent, while the
        6dF data are more spread out. This is because of local motions within galaxy
        clusters have not been corrected in these data. (Description from URL)
