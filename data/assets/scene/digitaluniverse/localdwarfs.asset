            a small number of large galaxies that are typically surrounded by a large
            number of small galaxies. The Milky Way belongs to the Local Group, and is one
            of roughly 100 galaxies in that group. The Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy
            (also known as Messier 31, or M31), and the Triangulum Galaxy (M33) are three
            of the largest galaxies in the Local Group. Each is a spiral galaxy containing
            hundreds of billions of stars. Surrounding the Milky Way and Andromeda are a
            bevy of dwarf galaxies-smaller, often irregular galaxies, that contain
            hundreds of millions to a few billion stars. (Description from URL) <br><br>
