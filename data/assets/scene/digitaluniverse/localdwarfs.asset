    Description = [[Census: 102 galaxies. DU Version 6.4. <br> A group of galaxies is
      a small number of large galaxies that are typically surrounded by a large
      number of small galaxies. The Milky Way belongs to the Local Group, and is one
      of roughly 100 galaxies in that group. The Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy
      (also known as Messier 31, or M31), and the Triangulum Galaxy (M33) are three
      of the largest galaxies in the Local Group. Each is a spiral galaxy containing
      hundreds of billions of stars. Surrounding the Milky Way and Andromeda are a
      bevy of dwarf galaxies-smaller, often irregular galaxies, that contain
      hundreds of millions to a few billion stars. (Description from URL) <br><br>
