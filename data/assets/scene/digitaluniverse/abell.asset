            includes all the nearby, and not so nearby, galaxy clusters. The northern
            hemisphere survey, published in 1958, was compiled by George Abell (1927â€“1983)
            from the Palomar Sky Survey plates. A subsequent southern hemisphere catalog
            was published posthumously in 1989. Further analysis by Brent Tully determined
            their distance and three-dimensional distribution. Each point in this data set
            represents a cluster of tens to hundreds (possibly even thousands) of
            galaxies, similar to the Virgo or Fornax Clusters. You will notice some points
            are assigned colors while most are gray. The data set also has an arbitrary
            cut-off for completeness, resulting in the rectangular shape of the data set.
