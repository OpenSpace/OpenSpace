    Description = [[Census 2,246 galaxies. DU Version 1.4. <br> The Abell catalog
        includes all the nearby, and not so nearby, galaxy clusters. The northern
        hemisphere survey, published in 1958, was compiled by George Abell (1927-1983)
        from the Palomar Sky Survey plates. A subsequent southern hemisphere catalog
        was published posthumously in 1989. Further analysis by Brent Tully determined
        their distance and three-dimensional distribution. Each point in this data set
        represents a cluster of tens to hundreds (possibly even thousands) of
        galaxies, similar to the Virgo or Fornax Clusters. You will notice some points
        are assigned colors while most are gray. The data set also has an arbitrary
        cut-off for completeness, resulting in the rectangular shape of the data set.
