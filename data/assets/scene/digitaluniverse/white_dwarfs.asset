    Description = [[A white dwarf is the core of a dying star. These are dim objects that
      are roughly the size of Earth but with the desity of a sunlike star. Stars that are
      not massive enough to end in a neutraon star or black hole will evolve into a white
      dwarf. This is the ultimate fate of over 95% of the stars in our Galaxy. As the
      star is dying, the outer layers will expand out and the gas will glow and become a
      planetaery nebula, while the core of the star transforms into a white dwarf. Census:
      192,613 white dwarfs.]]
