            clusters are gravitationally bound groups of 100,000 to 1 million stars. They
            are compact, spherical “balls” of stars with very high stellar densities in
            their centers (stars near their center are within a light year of one
            another). These clusters are typically 30 to 100 light years in diameter. If
            Earth were located inside one of these clusters, our sky would be lit by an
            abundance of stars brighter than the Sun. The globular clusters form one of
            the most complete data sets in the Atlas. Data for the clusters represent
            almost all the clusters in our Galaxy—several on the opposite side of Galactic
            center may be invisible to us. The clusters orbit the Milky Way in random 
            orientations, as comets orbit the Sun.(Description from URL) <br><br> Data
