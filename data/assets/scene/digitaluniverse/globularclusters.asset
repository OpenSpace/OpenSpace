      clusters are gravitationally bound groups of 100,000 to 1 million stars. They
      are compact, spherical "balls" of stars with very high stellar densities in
      their centers (stars near their center are within a light year of one
      another). These clusters are typically 30 to 100 light years in diameter. If
      Earth were located inside one of these clusters, our sky would be lit by an
      abundance of stars brighter than the Sun. The globular clusters form one of
      the most complete data sets in the Atlas. Data for the clusters represent
      almost all the clusters in our Galaxy—several on the opposite side of Galactic
      center may be invisible to us. The clusters orbit the Milky Way in random
      orientations, as comets orbit the Sun.(Description from URL) <br><br> Data
