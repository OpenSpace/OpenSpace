    Description = [[A group of galaxies is typically composed of a small number of large
      galaxies that are surrounded by a large number of small galaxies. The Milky Way
      belongs to the Local Group, and is one of roughly 100 galaxies in that group. The
      Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy (also known as Messier 31, or M31), and the
      Triangulum Galaxy (M33) are three of the largest galaxies in the Local Group. Each
      is a spiral galaxy containing hundreds of billions of stars. Surrounding the Milky
      Way and Andromeda are a bevy of dwarf galaxies--smaller, often irregular galaxies,
      that contain hundreds of millions to a few billion stars. Colors: Aqua are galaxies
      associated with the Milky Way, Yellow shows galaxies huddled around the Andromeda
      Galaxy, Green are other Local Group members, and Gray are neighboring galaxies not
      in the Local Group. Census: 102 galaxies.]]
