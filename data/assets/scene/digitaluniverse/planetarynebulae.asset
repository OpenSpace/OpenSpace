    Description = [[Census: 283 nebulae. DU Version 2.8. <br> A planetary nebula is an
      expanding shell of gas ejected from a star late in its life cycle. Appearing
      like greenish disks to a telescopic observer, planetary nebulae received their
      name from their resemblance to the gaseous planets of our solar system. In no
      way are they related to planets, rather, they are products of dying stars.
