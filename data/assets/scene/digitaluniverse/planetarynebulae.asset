    Description = [[A planetary nebula is an expanding shell of gas ejected from an
      average-sized star late in its life cycle. Appearing like greenish disks to a
      telescopic observer, planetary nebulae received their name from their resemblance to
      the gaseous planets of our solar system. In no way are they related to planets,
      rather, they are products of dying stars. As the gas from the star expands, it
      sweeps up the cooler gas like a snowplow. The gas glows because of the ultraviolet
      light from the stellar remnant at the center. Because the planetary nebula phase of
      a star's evolution is relatively short, we observe only those that have occurred
      recently in the younger stellar population. Therefore, we expect to see planetary
      nebulae in the disk of the Galaxy. Census: 1,657 planetary nebulae.]]
