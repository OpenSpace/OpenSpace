            expanding shell of gas ejected from a star late in its life cycle. Appearing
            like greenish disks to a telescopic observer, planetary nebulae received their
            name from their resemblance to the gaseous planets of our solar system. In no
            way are they related to planets, rather, they are products of dying stars.
