      galaxies. It includes over 30,000 galaxies in the local universe that surround the
      Milky Way. This catalog demonstrates the large-scale structure of the universe
      exceptionally well. Each galaxy has a representative image that is properly sized
      and inclined and reflects its morphological type. The data form a cube, which is an
      arbitrary cutoff based on the completeness of these data. Beyond this, data from
      these sources are not as reliable. The size of the cube is roughly 1 billion light
      years on a diagonal, or about 700 million light years per side. Colors: Orange
      denotes more dense regions of the local universe, aqua is given to galaxies in an
      intermediate-density area, and green is given to lower density regions. Census:
      30,059 galaxies.]]
