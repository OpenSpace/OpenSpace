    Description = [[Census: 30,059 galaxies. DU Version 1.5.<br> The Tully Catalog is
      the most polished, accurate catalog of nearby galaxies. It includes over 30,000
      galaxies in the local universe that surround the Milky Way. This catalog
      demonstrates the large-scale structure of the universe exceptionally well. And,
      each galaxy has a representative image reflecting its morphological type, and is
      properly sized and inclined. Size and shape. The data form a cube, which is an
      arbitrary cutoff based on the completeness of these data. Beyond this, data from
      these sources are not as reliable, so effort is made to show a complete picture,
      albeit limited by observations (for example, we cannot see dwarf galaxies much
      beyond the Local Group). The size of the cube is roughly 1 billion light years on
      a diagonal (so the farthest galaxies in the dataset are about 1 billion light
      years from the Milky Way), or about 700 million light years per side.
      <br><br>Colors. Orange denotes more dense regions of the local universe, aqua is
      given to galaxies in an intermediate-density area, and green is given to lower

      that represents its morphological type (spiral, elliptical, etc.). Most of these
      come from The Galaxy Catalog. A handful of nearby galaxies are represented by
      their actual images, which come mostly from the National Optical Astronomy
      Observatory (NOAO). Each of these images has been altered from its original state.
      These images were taken from Earth on some of the world's largest telescopes, so
      foreground stars from our own Galaxy appear in each image. We are representing
      galaxies in extragalactic space, so we have removed the stars from each image.
