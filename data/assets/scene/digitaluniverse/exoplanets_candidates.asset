    Description = [[Census: 6,082 stars with candidate planetary systems. DU Version 11.8.
      <br> The exoplanet candidate stars are likely hosts for exoplanets. These are stars
      plucked from NASA's Kepler and TESS space telescopes. The Kepler mission was
      designed to stare at one spot, roughly twelve degrees across, in the constellation
      Cygnus. By staring at one spot, the spacecraft could monitor over 500,000 stars in
      that field for subtle variations in brightness. The data included here are the stars
      that are considered good candidates to host planets. Rather than represent them
      photo-realistically, with accurate colors, we choose to visualize them as generic,
      pure yellow stars. (Description from URL) <br><br> Data Reference: NASA Exoplanet
