            H-two) regions are stellar nurseries for newborn stars. Stars are born from
            condensing clouds of hydrogen gas. As these clouds condense, the densities
            become high enough to form stars. From Earth's perspective, you'll notice that
            the H ii regions all lie close to the Galactic plane. This is not an accident
            of nature. These star-forming regions lie in the plane of the Galaxy because
            that is where star formation occurs in spiral galaxies such as our Milky Way.
            Because of this, they are great tracers of the spiral arms of the Galaxy, and
            were instrumental in our understanding of the Galaxy's overall structure
