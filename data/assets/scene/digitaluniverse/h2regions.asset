    Description = [[HII (pronounced "H-two") regions are stellar nurseries for newborn
      stars. Stars are born from condensing clouds of hydrogen gas. As these clouds
      condense, the densities become high enough to form stars. An HII region is the
      surrounding clouds of hydrogen that glow from the stars born within them. The
      result is a bright, glowing nebula which is seen to great distances. One local
      celebrity among HII regions is the Orion Nebula (M42). These star-forming regions
      lie in the plane of the Galaxy because that is where star formation occurs in
      spiral galaxies such as our Milky Way. Because of this, they are great tracers of
      the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Census: 1,108 star-forming regions.]]
