        stars are likely hosts for exoplanets. These are stars plucked from NASA's Kepler
        and TESS space telescopes. The Kepler mission was designed to stare at one spot,
        roughly twelve degrees across, in the constellation Cygnus. By staring at one
        spot, the spacecraft could monitor over 500,000 stars in that field for subtle
        variations in brightness.The data included here are the stars that are considered
        good candidates to host planets. Rather than represent them photo-realistically,
        with accurate colors, we choose to visualize them as generic, pure yellow stars.
