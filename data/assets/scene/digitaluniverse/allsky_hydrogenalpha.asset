    Description = [[Hydrogen-alpha is a term that describes light from the ground state of
      the hydrogen atom. When an electron in an atom moves from one energy level to a
      higher one, we say the atom is excited. When the electron moves back down to the
      lower energy level, light is released at a wavelength commensurate with the energy
      between the two levels. For the H-alpha line, this energy difference translates to a
      wavelength in the extreme red end of the visible spectrum. This survey of the sky is
      a snapshot of light from this wavelength.

      One distinctive element of the sky at this wavelength is the presence of large,
      spherical bubbles surrounding hot stars. Many nebulae and star-forming regions are
      visible, including the Great Nebula of Orion. We also see that galaxies emit H-alpha
      light, including the Andromeda Galaxy and the faint M33, the large face-on spiral in
      Triangulum, and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) in the southern
      sky. Census: 1 all-sky image.]]
