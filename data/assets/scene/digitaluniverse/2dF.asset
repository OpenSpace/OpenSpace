    Description = [[Census 229,293 galaxies. DU Version 1.7. <br> The Two-degree Field
    (2dF) Survey was a project designed to map portions of the extragalactic universe. The
    2dF instrument was mounted on the 3.9-meter (12.8-foot) Anglo-Australian Telescope
    (AAT), located 450 km (280 miles) northwest of Sydney. The telescope has a two-degree
    field of view on the sky, enabling large parts of the sky to be observed at one time.
    For each pointing of the telescope, the instrument can acquire up to 400 spectra
    simultaneously via optical fibers that feed into two spectrographs. Each spectrograph
    sees light that is between 350 nm and 800 nm, spanning the visible spectrum. <br><br>
    The 2dF survey has three main components: the North Galactic Pole strip, the South
    Galactic Pole strip, and the random fields that surround the South Galactic Pole
    strip. The galaxy survey is composed of about 230,000 galaxies with brightness and
    redshift measurements. (Description from URL) <br><br> Data Reference: 2dF Galaxy
    Redshift Survey (2dFGRS Team, 1998-2003)]]
