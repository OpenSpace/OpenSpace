        The Two-degree Field (2dF) Survey was a project designed to map portions of the
        extragalactic universe. The 2dF instrument was mounted on the 3.9-meter
        (12.8-foot) Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT), located 450 km (280 miles)
        northwest of Sydney. The telescope has a two-degree field of view on the sky,
        enabling large parts of the sky to be observed at one time. For each pointing of
        the telescope, the instrument can acquire up to 400 spectra simultaneously via
        optical fibers that feed into two spectrographs. Each spectrograph sees light
        that is between 350 nm and 800 nm, spanning the visible spectrum. <br><br> The
        2dF survey has three main components: the North Galactic Pole strip, the South
        Galactic Pole strip, and the random fields that surround the South Galactic Pole
        strip. The galaxy survey is composed of about 230,000 galaxies with brightness and
        redshift measurements. (Description from URL) <br><br> Data Reference: 2dF Galaxy
        Redshift Survey (2dFGRS Team, 1998-2003)]]
