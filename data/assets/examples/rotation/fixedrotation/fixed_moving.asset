-- Rotation Following One Moving Object
-- This asset creates a rotation that places coordinate axes orbiting close to a sphere
-- with the z axis always pointing towards the sphere as it orbits around the sphere. The
-- coordinate axes are translated away from the sphere to make that orientation more
-- obvious.
--
-- Making the `YAxis` { 0.0, 1.0, 0.0 } and actually using the orthogonal projection of
-- that direction means that the y axis of the new coordinate system will point in the
-- hemisphere in which the old y-axis was pointing, albeit being orthogonal to the other
-- specified axis. That axis is pointing towards the scene graph node holding the sphere.
