-- No Interpolation
-- This asset creates a SceneGraphNode that only displays coordinate axes. The rotation of
-- the coordinate axes are determined by a timeline of individual rotations that are used
-- without interpolating between the timeline entries. These rotations are keyframes that
-- are used to change between different orientations. This example transitions between
-- three rotations. In this example, the interpolation between entries is disabled, which
-- will cause the coordinate axes to change their orientation abruptly when the rotation
-- changes. If the interpolation were enabled, the orientation of the coordinate axes
-- would transition seamlessly instead at the provided times. This example will only work
-- if the in-game time is set to January 1st, 2000.
