-- No Interpolation
-- This asset creates a SceneGraphNode that only displays coordinate axes. The rotation of
-- coordinate axes are determined by a timeline of individual rotations. These rotations
-- are keyframes that are used to change between different orientations. This example
-- transitions between three rotations. As the interpolation between entries is disabled,
-- the orientation will change abruptly at the provided times. This example will also only
-- work if the in-game time is set to January 1st, 2000.
