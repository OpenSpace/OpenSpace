-- No Interpolation
-- This asset creates a scene graph node that only displays coordinate axes whose
-- translation of the coordinate axes is determined by a timeline of individual
-- translations that are used without interpolating between the timeline entries. These
-- translations are keyframes that are used to change between different positions.
--
-- This example transitions between three positions. In this example, the interpolation
-- between entries is disabled, which will cause the coordinate axes to change their
-- position abruptly when the translation changes. If the interpolation were enabled, the
-- orientation of the coordinate axes would transition seamlessly instead at the provided
-- times.
--
-- This example will only work if the in-game time is set to January 1st, 2000.
