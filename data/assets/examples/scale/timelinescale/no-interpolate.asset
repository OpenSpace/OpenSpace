-- No Interpolation
-- This asset creates a scene graph node that only displays coordinate axes. The scale of
-- the coordinate axes are determined by a timeline of individual scales that are used
-- without interpolating between the timeline entries. These scales are keyframes that are
-- used to change between different sizes. This example transitions between three sizes.
-- In this example, the interpolation between entries is disabled, which will cause the
-- coordinate axes to change their size abruptly when the scale changes. If the
-- interpolation were enabled, the orientation of the coordinate axes would transition
-- seamlessly instead at the provided times. This example will only work if the in-game
-- time is set to January 1st, 2000.
