-- Voyager sonification
-- This example adds the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes to the NodesTelemetry in the
-- Telemetry module. This should be used together with the voyager-sonification.scd file
-- in SuperCollider to listen to an example sonification of the Voyager probes.
--
-- This is a good foundation for creating your own sonification of any node(s) in
-- OpenSpace. If you want to use this to create your own sonification, you can copy this
-- file and the voyager-sonification.scd file to your own asset folder and modify them to
-- your liking. In this file, that modification would be to replace the Voyager 1 and 2
-- identifiers with the identifiers of the node(s) you want to sonify instead.
--
-- For more information about sonification in OpenSpace and how to use it, see the
-- documentation:
-- https://docs.openspaceproject.com/latest/creating-data-assets/modules/telemetry/sonification.html
