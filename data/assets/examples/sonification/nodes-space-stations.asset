-- Nodes sonification
-- This example adds the ISS and Tiangong space stations to the NodesTelemetry in the
-- Telemetry module. This should be used together with the nodesSonification.scd file in
-- SuperCollider to listen to an example sonification of the nodes.
--
-- This is a good foundation for creating your own sonification of any node(s) in
-- OpenSpace. If you want to use this to create your own sonification, you can copy this
-- file and the nodesSonification.scd file to your own asset folder and modify them to
-- your liking. In this file, that modification would be to replace the ISS and Tiangong
-- identifies with the identifiers of the node(s) you want to sonify instead.
--
-- For more information about sonification in OpenSpace and how to use it, see the
-- documentation:
-- https://docs.openspaceproject.com/latest/creating-data-assets/modules/telemetry/sonification.html
