-- Orientation - Face Camera Position
-- This example creates a point cloud where the planes that make up the points are
-- oriented to face the camera position, rather than the view direction (which is
-- default). This means that the point will be layed out in a spherical way around the
-- camera, which works better for spherical displays compared to the default
-- orientation.
--
-- A texture is added so that we can more easily see how the orientation is altered.
-- See Textured example for more details.
