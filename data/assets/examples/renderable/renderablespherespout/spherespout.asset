-- This example renders a sphere with a texture that is provided by another application
-- on the same computer using the SPOUT library. Note that this library is only available
-- on Windows. A SPOUT-enabled application can share a texture using a user-defined
-- name, which is used as the `SpoutName` here to receive that image. This allows the
-- integration of any generated image.
