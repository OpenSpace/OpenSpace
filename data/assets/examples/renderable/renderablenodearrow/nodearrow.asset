-- Basic
-- This example shows an arrow pointing from one scene graph node in the direction of
-- another. Here, it points from Earth to Mars.
--
-- Note that the arrows are generated as objects in 3D space and need to have a size
-- that is suitable for the scene graph nodes they refer to. Here it is set based on
-- the size of the Earth.
