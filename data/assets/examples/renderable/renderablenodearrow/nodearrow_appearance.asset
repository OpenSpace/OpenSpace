-- Custom Appearance (Colored & Inverted)
-- This example shows an arrow pointing from one scene graph node in the direction of
-- another. Here, it is created with the Solar System barycenter as start node and
-- Earth as end node, but the arrow direction is inverted so that it points towards
-- the Solar System barycenter. Some appearance related properties are also changed to
-- customize the look of the arrow, but default values are used for its size.
