     * Horizontal: Calculate the angle to the object in the horizontal direction within
     *             the camera plane. This mode is suitable for flat displays or forward
     *             facing immersive envierments (such as the Norrk√∂ping dome theater).
     *             The camera plane is the plane of the camera view direction + camera
     *             left direction (i.e. the negative camera right direction), with the
     *             camera up direction as the normal. The angle goes from -pi to pi in
     *             radians and zero degrees would be forward in the camera view direction.
     *             When the object is located towards the left relative the camera view
     *             direction, then the angle will be a positive value. If instead, the
     *             object is located towards the right, the angle will become negative.
     *
     * Circular: Calculate the angle to the object in circular space around the center
     *           point in the camera view plane. This mode is suitable for centered
     *           fisheye displays or omnidirectional immersive environments (such as the
     *           Hayden planetarium). The camera view plane is the plane of the camera up
     *           direction + camera left direction (i.e. the negative camera right
     *           direction), with the negative camera view direction as the normal. The

     *           value. If instead, the object is located towards the right, the angle
