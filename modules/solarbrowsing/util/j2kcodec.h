 * TODO(mnoven): A simple wrapper around openjpeg. As of 08/24/17 openjpeg has 3 major bottlenecks which are
 * listed below:
 *
 * 1. We can't perform decoding on multiple threads, this feature is not stable and results
 *    in a segmentation fault.
 * 2. We want to be able to decode directly into our buffer without having to go through the opj_image_t object.
 *    See: https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/issues/837
 * 3. Decoding precison is always 32-bits integers, meaning conversion has to be done if 8-bytes are preferred.
 *    See: https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/issues/836
