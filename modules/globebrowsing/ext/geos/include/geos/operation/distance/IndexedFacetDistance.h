/// \brief Computes the distance between the facets (segments and vertices)
/// of two [Geometrys](\ref geom::Geometry) using a Branch-and-Bound algorithm.
///
/// The Branch-and-Bound algorithm operates over a traversal of R-trees built
/// on the target and the query geometries.
///
/// This approach provides the following benefits:
///
/// - Performance is dramatically improved due to the use of the R-tree index
///   and the pruning due to the Branch-and-Bound approach
/// - The spatial index on the target geometry is cached which allow reuse in
///   an repeated query situation.
///
/// Using this technique is usually much more performant than using the
/// brute-force \ref geom::Geometry::distance(const Geometry* g) const when one
/// or both input geometries are large, or when evaluating many distance
/// computations against a single geometry.
