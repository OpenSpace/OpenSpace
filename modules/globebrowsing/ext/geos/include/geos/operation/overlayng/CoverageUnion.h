/**
 * Unions a valid coverage of polygons or lines
 * in an efficient way.
 *
 * A valid polygonal coverage is a collection of geom::Polygon
 * which satisfy the following conditions:
 *
 *  * Vector-clean - Line segments within the collection
 *    must either be identical or intersect only at endpoints.
 *  * Non-overlapping - No two polygons
 *    may overlap. Equivalently, polygons must be interior-disjoint.
 *
 * A valid linear coverage is a collection of geom::LineString
 * which satisfies the Vector-clean condition.
 * Note that this does not require the LineStrings to be fully noded
 * - i.e. they may contain coincident linework.
 * Coincident line segments are dissolved by the union.
 * Currently linear output is not merged (this may be added in a future release.)
 *
 * Currently no checking is done to determine whether the input is a valid coverage.
 * This is because coverage validation involves segment intersection detection,
 * which is much more expensive than the union phase.
 * If the input is not a valid coverage
 * then in some cases this will be detected during processing
 * and a util::TopologyException is thrown.
 * Otherwise, the computation will produce output, but it will be invalid.
 *
 * Unioning a valid coverage implies that no new vertices are created.
 * This means that a precision model does not need to be specified.
 * The precision of the vertices in the output geometry is not changed.
