/** \brief
 * Computes a point in the interior of an areal geometry.
 * The point will lie in the geometry interior
 * in all except certain pathological cases.
 *
 * <h2>Algorithm</h2>
 * For each input polygon:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Determine a horizontal scan line on which the interior
 * point will be located.
 * To increase the chance of the scan line
 * having non-zero-width intersection with the polygon
 * the scan line Y ordinate is chosen to be near the centre of the polygon's
 * Y extent but distinct from all of vertex Y ordinates.
 * <li>Compute the sections of the scan line
 * which lie in the interior of the polygon.
 * <li>Choose the widest interior section
 * and take its midpoint as the interior point.
 * </ul>
 * The final interior point is chosen as
 * the one occurring in the widest interior section.
 * <p>
 * This algorithm is a tradeoff between performance
 * and point quality (where points further from the geometry
 * boundary are considered to be higher quality)
 * Priority is given to performance.
 * This means that the computed interior point
 * may not be suitable for some uses
 * (such as label positioning).
 * <p>
 * The algorithm handles some kinds of invalid/degenerate geometry,
 * including zero-area and self-intersecting polygons.
 * <p>
 * Empty geometry is handled by returning a <code>null</code> point.
 *
 * <h3>KNOWN BUGS</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If a fixed precision model is used, in some cases this method may return
 * a point which does not lie in the interior.
 * <li>If the input polygon is <i>extremely</i> narrow the computed point
 * may not lie in the interior of the polygon.
 * </ul>
