/** \brief
 * Counts the number of segments crossed by a horizontal ray extending to the
 * right from a given point, in an incremental fashion.
 *
 * This can be used to determine whether a point lies in a polygonal geometry.
 * The class determines the situation where the point lies exactly on a segment.
 * When being used for Point-In-Polygon determination, this case allows
 * short-circuiting the evaluation.
 *
 * This class handles polygonal geometries with any number of shells and holes.
 * The orientation of the shell and hole rings is unimportant.
 * In order to compute a correct location for a given polygonal geometry,
 * it is essential that **all** segments are counted which
 *
 * - touch the ray
 * - lie in in any ring which may contain the point
 *
 * The only exception is when the point-on-segment situation is detected, in
 * which case no further processing is required.
 * The implication of the above rule is that segments which can be a priori
 * determined to *not* touch the ray (i.e. by a test of their bounding box or
 * Y-extent) do not need to be counted. This allows for optimization by indexing.
