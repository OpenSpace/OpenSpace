/** \brief
 * Functions to compute the orientation of basic geometric structures
 * including point triplets (triangles) and rings.
 *
 * Orientation is a fundamental property of planar geometries
 * (and more generally geometry on two-dimensional manifolds).
 *
 * Orientation is notoriously subject to numerical precision errors
 * in the case of collinear or nearly collinear points.
 * JTS uses extended-precision arithmetic to increase
 * the robustness of the computation.
