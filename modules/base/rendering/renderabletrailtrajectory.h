 * its shape. The trail is sampled equitemporal (with an interval of _sampleInterval in
 * seconds) between the _startTime and the _endTime. No further update is needed until any
 * of these three values is changed. If _renderFullTrail is true, the entirety of the
 * trail is rendered, regardless of the simulation time. If it is false, the trail is only
 * rendered from the past to the current simulation time, not showing any part of the
 * trail in the future. If _renderFullTrail is false, the current position of the object
 * has to be updated constantly to make the trail connect to the object that has the
 * trail.
