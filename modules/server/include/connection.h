// @TODO (abock, 2022-05-06) This is not really elegant as there is no need for a
// Connection to be held by a shared_ptr, but there was a problem with the LuaScriptTopic
// otherwise (issue #1940).
// The problem there is that the LuaScriptTopic is keeping a copy of the _connection in
// its lambda to return a script back to the caller. The script is only queued, so is
// executed a bit longer. If the UI gets reloaded in between the creation of the lambda
// and the execution, the _connection will be an invalid pointer and the program will
// crash. Making this a shared_ptr circumvents that problem my having the lamdba retain
// ownership of the _connection and keeping it alive until the message is sent. The
// message doesn't go anywhere since noone is listening, but it's better than a crash.
